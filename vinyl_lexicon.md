## A/B Test Press
(**noun.**) A preliminary batch of records pressed by a plant in two slightly different ways — for example, using different lacquers, vinyl compounds, or groove depths — to compare sound quality before committing to a full run.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from the term “A/B testing” in audio engineering and product design, meaning to compare two variants side-by-side.

**Example:** 
“The label did an A/B test press to decide whether the translucent blue or the standard black had better low-end response.”

**Cultural Note:** Collectors often hunt down these pressings because only a handful were ever made — sometimes as few as 5–10 copies — making them grail-level items.

**See also:**  test press, lacquer cut, first pressing

## Acetate
(**noun.**) A soft lacquer-coated aluminum (or occasionally glass) disc used to cut the very first playable copy of a recording straight from the mastering lathe. Acetates wear out fast — maybe 10–20 plays — but capture the freshest, most dynamic version of a track.

**Etymology:** Named for the nitrocellulose acetate lacquer layer applied over the disc’s base.

**Example:** 
“I scored an acetate of a lost 1972 soul demo — the paper label is handwritten in ballpoint.”

**Cultural Note:** In the ’50s and ’60s, DJs prized acetates for breaking brand-new singles in clubs before commercial pressings existed. Jamaican sound-system culture still calls them dubplates.

**See also:**  dubplate, lacquer cut, reference disc

## Acoustic Suspension
(**noun.**) A sealed-box speaker-cabinet design popular from the late ’50s onward, known for tight, deep bass response — a favorite among hi-fi vinyl listeners seeking accurate low-end without port “boom.”

**Etymology:** Refers to the trapped air inside the sealed cabinet acting as an acoustic spring that controls woofer movement.

**Example:** 
“Pair that vintage AR-3a with a clean 60-watt tube amp and you’ll hear why acoustic suspension ruled the ’60s hi-fi scene.”

**Cultural Note:** Acoustic-suspension speakers were marketed as the perfect match for vinyl’s warmth during the golden age of living-room hi-fi consoles.

**See also:**  ported enclosure, infinite baffle

## Add-On Arm Weight
(**noun.**) A small auxiliary weight attached to the rear of a tonearm or to a detachable headshell to balance heavier cartridges or DJ styli.

**Etymology:** Plainly descriptive of its function — adding weight to the arm.

**Example:** 
“After swapping to that chunky Shure M44-7 cart, I had to screw on an add-on arm weight to keep the tracking force correct.”

**Cultural Note:** Battle DJs often keep a couple of nickel-sized arm weights taped under the turntable lid.

**See also:**  counterweight, tracking force, headshell

## Album
(**noun.**) A collection of musical tracks issued as a cohesive package on a single or multi-disc vinyl release. On LPs (33⅓ rpm, 12-inch), an album typically runs 30–50 minutes per disc.

**Etymology:** Originally referred to bound “albums” of 78 rpm sleeves before the LP format allowed multiple songs on one disc.

**Example:** 
“His debut album still sounds best on the original 1978 U.K. pressing — the remaster is too bright.”

**Cultural Note:** The term survived the jump from physical binders to LPs and later to CDs and streaming playlists.

**See also:**  LP, EP, double-album, concept album

## Alignment Protractor
(**noun.**) A printed or mirrored template used to align a turntable cartridge so the stylus tracks grooves at the proper angle across the record’s radius, minimizing distortion.

**Etymology:** Named after the geometry tool — it projects alignment lines over the tonearm arc.

**Example:** 
“Grab an alignment protractor before you blame the inner-groove distortion on your pressing.”

**Cultural Note:** Hi-fi hobbyists often debate Baerwald vs Stevenson vs Löfgren alignment geometries on forums late into the night.

**See also:**  cartridge setup, overhang, tracking angle

## Alternate Take
(**noun.**) A different recorded version of the same song or performance, sometimes issued later on vinyl re-releases or deluxe box sets.

**Etymology:** Straight from studio lingo — each full run-through is a “take.”

**Example:** 
“That Blue Note reissue includes the fiery alternate take that never made the original 1964 LP.”

**Cultural Note:** Hunting for alternate-take pressings is a cornerstone of deep-cut collecting in jazz, blues, and reggae.

**See also:**  outtake, session tape, box set

## Anti-Skate
(**noun.**) A spring- or magnet-based control on turntables that counteracts the inward pull on the tonearm caused by groove friction, helping the stylus stay centered in the groove.

**Etymology:** Describes its job: reducing the “skating” force that drags the needle toward the label.

**Example:** 
“Dial in a touch more anti-skate or the right channel will distort before the left.”

**Cultural Note:** Scratch DJs sometimes defeat anti-skate entirely to keep the stylus locked under back-cue pressure.

**See also:**  tracking force, tonearm, groove wear

## Audiophile Pressing
(**noun.**) A premium vinyl release manufactured with meticulous mastering, heavier virgin-vinyl stock (often 180 g or 200 g), and quality-controlled plating for superior sound.

**Etymology:** Combines *audio* + *philos* (Greek “loving”) — literally, “lover of high-fidelity sound.”

**Example:** 
“That 200-gram audiophile pressing from Mobile Fidelity wipes the floor with the budget reissue.”

**Cultural Note:** These pressings fueled the late-’70s and ’80s resurgence of hi-fi vinyl for serious listeners willing to pay extra for sonic nirvana.

**See also:**  half-speed master, virgin vinyl, 180-gram

## Automatic Return
(**noun.**) A mechanical or electronic feature on many consumer turntables that automatically lifts and returns the tonearm to its rest at the end of a side.

**Etymology:** Literal description of the function — automating the return cycle.

**Example:** 
“The old Technics belt-drive still has a smooth automatic return — no need to jump up at the run-out groove.”

**Cultural Note:** Audiophile purists often prefer fully manual decks, believing fewer moving parts mean less vibration and better fidelity.

**See also:**  cue lever, semi-automatic, fully manual

## Auxiliary Weight (DJ Slang: “Slug”)
**noun / slang.**
Extra mass clipped or screwed to the tonearm or headshell to stabilize the stylus under heavy back-cueing and scratching.

**Etymology:** “Slug” as in a chunk of metal — common battle-DJ jargon.

**Example:** 
“Throw a slug on that arm before you start juggling — you’ll cut down on needle hop.”

**Cultural Note:** Hip-hop turntablism in the ’80s popularized improvised slugs — sometimes literal coins or washers taped to the headshell.

**See also:**  add-on arm weight, tracking force, battle DJ

# B

## Back-Spinning
**verb / noun.**
Spinning the record backward quickly — either to rewind to a section or to create the signature “stutter” sound effect in scratching.

**Etymology:** Self-descriptive — literally spinning the record backward.

**Example:** 
“Grandmaster Flash made that back-spinning breakbeat loop famous in the park jams.”

**Cultural Note:** Integral to hip-hop DJ technique; also used by radio DJs in the ’70s to censor live mistakes by rewinding a few seconds.

## Back-Splice (a.k.a. Back-Tape)
**noun / verb.**
The practice of taping or splicing two pieces of the same breakbeat back-to-back on reel-to-reel or acetate to create an endless loop before samplers existed.

**Etymology:** From the physical splicing of magnetic tape’s *back* end to its *front*.

**Example:**

**See also:**  edit, reel-to-reel, breakbeat

## Balance Weight (Tonearm)
(**noun.**) The counterweight at the rear of a tonearm used to set the proper tracking force for the stylus.

**Etymology:** Literal — balances the tonearm.

**Example:** 
“After swapping carts, always reset the balance weight before dialing in tracking force.”

**Cultural Note:** Many ’70s consumer decks hid a spring inside instead of a visible weight; audiophiles prefer a solid machined counterweight.

**See also:**  tracking force, auxiliary weight, anti-skate

## Banding (Groove Banding)
(**noun.**) Visible spacing or “bands” in the grooves of an LP that indicate separate tracks; silent grooves cut between songs.


**Etymology:** Refers to the *bands* of smooth, unmodulated groove between recorded sections.


**Example:** “You can spot the drum solo on that prog LP by the narrow band halfway through side two.”


**Cultural Note:** Some concept albums were cut without banding to create a continuous play-through.


**See also:**  locked groove, run-out groove, hidden track

## Basket-Case Copy
**noun / slang.**
Collector slang for a record in extremely poor physical condition — warped, cracked, or otherwise beyond realistic repair.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from general slang meaning “hopeless case.”

**Example:** 
“That first-press *Kind of Blue* looked tempting, but it’s a basket-case copy — water damage everywhere.”

**Cultural Note:** Some collectors still buy basket-case copies of ultra-rare titles just for the jacket or label variations.

**See also:**  pitch control

## Belt-Drive Turntable
(**noun.**) A turntable whose platter is spun by an elastic belt connecting it to a motor pulley — prized for vibration isolation but slower to start/stop than direct-drive.

**Etymology:** Describes the belt-driven design.

**Example:** 
“A belt-drive deck like the Rega Planar 3 gives a sweeter midrange but isn’t great for DJ scratching.”

**Cultural Note:** Dominant in hi-fi home decks of the ’70s–’90s; direct-drive won in clubs for torque and durability.

**See also:**  direct-drive, idler-wheel, wow & flutter

## Binaural Recording
(**noun.**) A recording technique using two microphones spaced roughly like human ears — intended for playback over headphones but fascinating on high-resolution vinyl.

**Example:** 
“I’ve got the original U.K. white-label of that rave anthem — came in a die-cut sleeve with just a sticker catalog number.”

**Cultural Note:** Crucial to dance-music scenes (garage, jungle, techno) where DJs wanted hot tracks before official release.

**See also:**  promo copy, test press, dubplate

## Blank Groove / Locked Groove
(**noun.**) A closed circular groove at the end of a side that loops endlessly instead of spiraling to the label.

**Etymology:** “Locked” because the groove locks the stylus in a circle.

**Example:** 
“Sgt. Pepper’s U.K. first press has a cheeky locked groove with random gibberish after the final chord.”

**Cultural Note:** A playground for avant-garde and dance producers who’d hide Easter-egg audio or locked drum loops.

**See also:**  run-out groove, hidden track, banding

## Bootleg
**noun / slang.**
An unauthorized vinyl pressing of live concerts, unreleased studio takes, or remixes — often cut from radio broadcasts or tapes without the artist’s consent.
