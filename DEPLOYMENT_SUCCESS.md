## üìã Next Steps for hellowaxly.com Custom Domain

To make hellowaxly.com work, you need to configure DNS at your domain registrar:

### DNS Configuration Required

#### A Records (Root Domain)
Add these four A records:

```
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.108.153
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.109.153
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.110.153
Type: A, Name: @, Value: 185.199.111.153
```

#### CNAME Record (www subdomain)
```
Type: CNAME, Name: www, Value: darthrootbeer.github.io
```

### After DNS Propagation (1-48 hours)

1. Go to https://github.com/darthrootbeer/waxly/settings/pages
2. Verify that "Custom domain" shows **hellowaxly.com** with a green checkmark
3. Check **"Enforce HTTPS"** (highly recommended)
4. Visit https://hellowaxly.com to see your live site!
