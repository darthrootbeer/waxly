# Idler-Wheel Drive

**Definition:** A classic turntable mechanism where a rubber-covered wheel transmits power from the motor spindle to the platter’s inner rim — famous for torque and “drive,” often with slight rumble.

**Etymology:** Named for the intermediate *idler-wheel* that connects motor to platter.

**Example:** “That Thorens TD-124 uses idler-wheel drive — you can feel the platter leap to speed almost instantly.”

**Cultural Note:** * Dominated radio-station decks and early hi-fi tables of the 1950s-60s; revered today by restorers for its punchy sound.
