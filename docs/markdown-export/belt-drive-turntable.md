# Belt-Drive Turntable

**Definition:** A turntable whose platter is spun by an elastic belt connecting it to a motor pulley — prized for vibration isolation but slower to start/stop than direct-drive.

**Etymology:** Describes the belt-driven design.

**Example:** “A belt-drive deck like the Rega Planar 3 gives a sweeter midrange but isn’t great for DJ scratching.”

**Cultural Note:** * Dominant in hi-fi home decks of the ’70s–’90s; direct-drive won in clubs for torque and durability.
