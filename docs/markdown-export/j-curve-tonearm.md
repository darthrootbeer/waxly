# J-Curve Tonearm

**Definition:** A tonearm shaped with a gentle “J” bend near the headshell end, often seen on broadcast and some DJ decks — believed to optimize geometry and reduce tracking error compared to straight arms.

**Etymology:** Named for its curved “J”-like shape.

**Example:** “Vintage Technics broadcast tables often used a J-curve tonearm for better inner-groove tracking.”

**Cultural Note:** * Classic look of ’70s-’80s pro turntables; still a design-choice debate among audiophiles vs straight-arm fans.
