# Feedthrough

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A manufacturing defect where a loud signal on one groove wall slightly imprints as a faint echo in the adjacent groove, audible a split-second early or late.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — audio “feeds through” the lacquer wall during cutting or pressing.

**Example:** “You can hear pre-echo on that quiet piano intro — classic feed-through groove from a hot cut.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on hot-cut 12-inch singles; largely minimized by modern plating techniques.
