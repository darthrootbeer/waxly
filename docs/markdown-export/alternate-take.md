# Alternate Take

**Definition:** A different recorded version of the same song or performance, sometimes issued later on vinyl re-releases or deluxe box sets.

**Etymology:** Straight from studio lingo — each full run-through is a “take.”

**Example:** “That Blue Note reissue includes the fiery alternate take that never made the original 1964 LP.”

**Cultural Note:** * Hunting for alternate-take pressings is a cornerstone of deep-cut collecting in jazz, blues, and reggae.
