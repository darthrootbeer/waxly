# Balance Weight

**Definition:** The counterweight at the rear of a tonearm used to set the proper tracking force for the stylus.

**Etymology:** Literal — balances the tonearm.

**Example:** “After swapping carts, always reset the balance weight before dialing in tracking force.”

**Cultural Note:** * Many ’70s consumer decks hid a spring inside instead of a visible weight; audiophiles prefer a solid machined counterweight.
