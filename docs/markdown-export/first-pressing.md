# First Pressing

**Definition:** The earliest commercial pressing run of a release — usually cut closest to the original master lacquer before metal parts wear or mastering changes occur.

**Etymology:** Plain — the *first* batch *pressed* for sale.

**Example:** “The first pressing with the turquoise-lettered cover sounds hotter than all later reissues.”

**Cultural Note:** * A cornerstone term in collector value — minute label or matrix differences separate first from later runs.
