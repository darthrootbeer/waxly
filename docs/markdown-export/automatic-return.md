# Automatic Return

**Definition:** A mechanical or electronic feature on many consumer turntables that automatically lifts and returns the tonearm to its rest at the end of a side.

**Etymology:** Literal description of the function — automating the return cycle.

**Example:** “The old Technics belt-drive still has a smooth automatic return — no need to jump up at the run-out groove.”

**Cultural Note:** * Audiophile purists often prefer fully manual decks, believing fewer moving parts mean less vibration and better fidelity.
