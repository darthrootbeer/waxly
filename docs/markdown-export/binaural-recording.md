# Binaural Recording

**Definition:** A recording technique using two microphones spaced roughly like human ears — intended for playback over headphones but fascinating on high-resolution vinyl.

**Etymology:** From *bi-* (“two”) + *aural* (“ears”).

**Example:** “That 1978 Sheffield Lab binaural LP puts the drum kit right in front of you in 3-D space.”

**Cultural Note:** * A short-lived audiophile craze in the late ’70s; today prized by headphone enthusiasts collecting oddball pressings.
