# Noise

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The inherent background level of noise — hiss, hum, surface-whoosh — present in a system or on the vinyl itself below which musical signal sits.

**Etymology:** Audio-engineering term for the “*floor*” of unwanted *noise*.

**Example:** “Virgin-vinyl pressings have a lower noise-floor than recycled PVC budget cuts.”

**Cultural Note:** * A core metric of vinyl playback chain quality — from cartridge to pre-amp to pressing compound.
