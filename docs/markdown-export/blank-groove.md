# Blank Groove

**Definition:** A closed circular groove at the end of a side that loops endlessly instead of spiraling to the label.

**Etymology:** “Locked” because the groove locks the stylus in a circle.

**Example:** “Sgt. Pepper’s U.K. first press has a cheeky locked groove with random gibberish after the final chord.”

**Cultural Note:** * A playground for avant-garde and dance producers who’d hide Easter-egg audio or locked drum loops.
