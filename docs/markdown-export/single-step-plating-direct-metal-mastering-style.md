# Single-Step Plating

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing method.** A **plating process that skips the usual father–mother–stamper chain**, creating stampers straight from the lacquer or copper DMM — limits copies but yields very close-to-master sound.

**Etymology:** Industrial phrase: a *single step* from cut master to stamper.

**Example:** “That boutique label advertises single-step plating for maximum fidelity — only 1,000 pressings before the stamper wears.”

**Cultural Note:** * Revived by modern audiophile reissue houses for limited “One-Step” box sets.
