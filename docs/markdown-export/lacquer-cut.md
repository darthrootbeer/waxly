# Lacquer Cut

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The very first disc created on a cutting lathe, made of soft nitrocellulose lacquer on an aluminum substrate. It carries the original grooves carved directly from the master audio signal before electroplating into metal stampers.

**Etymology:** Plain description — the groove is *cut into lacquer.*

**Example:** “The hot RL lacquer cut of *Led Zeppelin II* was so loud it caused early skips.”

**Cultural Note:** * A holy grail in collectors’ circles: original ‘hot’ lacquers often sound best but are rarely sold publicly.
