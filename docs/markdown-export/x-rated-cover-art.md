# X-Rated Cover Art

**Definition:** **noun / mastering test.** A **trial lacquer groove cut in an ‘X’ pattern or cross-hatch** used by engineers to test cutterhead alignment and groove depth before committing to a full lacquer side.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from film-ratings slang — *X-rated* for explicit or shocking art.

**Example:** “The original X-rated cover art for the Scorpions’ *Virgin Killer* was quickly withdrawn, making first-press sleeves rare.”

**Cultural Note:** * A major sub-genre in cover-art collecting; often the target of ‘banned-cover’ reissue hype.
