# Back-Splice

**Definition:** **noun / verb.** The practice of taping or splicing two pieces of the same breakbeat back-to-back on reel-to-reel or acetate to create an endless loop before samplers existed.

**Etymology:** From the physical splicing of magnetic tape’s *back* end to its *front*.

**Example:** “Before Serato, Bronx DJs were doing back-splice edits on quarter-inch tape to extend the drums.”

**Cultural Note:** * An ancestor of the remix and the breakbeat-loop aesthetic; shows how vinyl and tape cultures overlapped.
