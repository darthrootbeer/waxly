# Jukebox EP

**Definition:** A 7-inch extended-play record made specifically for jukeboxes — often with oversized center holes and 33⅓ RPM speed to squeeze 2-3 songs per side.

**Etymology:** Literal — an *EP* tailored for *jukebox* mechanisms.

**Example:** “The diner’s Seeburg still spins vintage jukebox EPs with four Elvis tunes on one disc.”

**Cultural Note:** * A vital transitional format during the late-’50s as jukebox operators wanted more songs per slot without upsizing the machine.
