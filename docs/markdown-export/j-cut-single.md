# J-Cut Single

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A record pressed with the lead-in groove unusually short — almost shaped like a “J” hugging the label — meaning the song starts very close to the label.

**Etymology:** Collector slang likening the shallow lead-in spiral to a “J” curve.

**Example:** “That soul 45 is a notorious J-cut single — cue-burned to death because the intro’s right at the label.”

**Cultural Note:** * Often a quirk of certain ’60s-’70s 7-inch pressing plants.
