# Groove Guard

**Definition:** A subtle raised lip molded around the outer edge (and sometimes inner label ring) of most modern LPs to keep grooves from touching flat surfaces when stacked or sleeved.

**Etymology:** A marketing term coined in the late ’50s for the *guard* ridge protecting grooves.

**Example:** “Early flat-edge Blue Notes lack the later groove guard that kept records safer in piles.”

**Cultural Note:** * An industry standard after about 1960 — makes shipping and auto-changers safer for discs.
