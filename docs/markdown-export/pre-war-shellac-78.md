# Pre-War Shellac 78

**Definition:** **noun / historical format.** Any 10- or 12-inch shellac disc manufactured **before World War II**, usually recorded by acoustic or early-electrical methods and extremely brittle compared with later vinyl pressings.

**Etymology:** Literally: *pre-war* era + *shellac 78 RPM* disc.

**Example:** “That pre-war shellac 78 of Bessie Smith must be played with a 3-mil steel needle at 78 RPM.”

**Cultural Note:** * A cornerstone of early jazz / blues collecting — demands specialized stylus size, heavier tracking force, and strictly no lightweight modern needles.
