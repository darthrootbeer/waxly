# Basket

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Collector slang for a record in extremely poor physical condition — warped, cracked, or otherwise beyond realistic repair.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from general slang meaning “hopeless case.”

**Example:** “That first-press *Kind of Blue* looked tempting, but it’s a basket-case copy — water damage everywhere.”

**Cultural Note:** * Some collectors still buy basket-case copies of ultra-rare titles just for the jacket or label variations.
