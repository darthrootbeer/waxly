# Platter Ring

**Definition:** **noun / grading slang.** A faint circular shadow or gloss change on an LP jacket front or back that mirrors the record’s outline inside — caused by years of pressure and shelf-rub.

**Etymology:** Visual *ring-wear* imprint from the disc resting against the jacket board.

**Example:** “The jacket grades VG+ due to a light platter ring-wear shadow on the back panel.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on 1960s–70s jackets stored without outer sleeves; lowers collector grade.
