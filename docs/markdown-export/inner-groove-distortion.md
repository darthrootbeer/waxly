# Inner-Groove Distortion

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** Audible high-frequency harshness or sibilance that occurs near the record’s center due to the stylus tracing a tighter groove radius at lower linear speed.

**Etymology:** Literal — distortion at the *inner grooves.*

**Example:** “Switching to an elliptical stylus cleaned up the inner-groove distortion on the final track.”

**Cultural Note:** * Cartridge alignment, stylus profile, and groove-spacing strategies were all developed to combat this LP limitation.
