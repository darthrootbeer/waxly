# Auxiliary Weight

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Extra mass clipped or screwed to the tonearm or headshell to stabilize the stylus under heavy back-cueing and scratching.

**Etymology:** “Slug” as in a chunk of metal — common battle-DJ jargon.

**Example:** “Throw a slug on that arm before you start juggling — you’ll cut down on needle hop.”

**Cultural Note:** * Hip-hop turntablism in the ’80s popularized improvised slugs — sometimes literal coins or washers taped to the headshell.
