# Null-Test

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A test comparing two audio signals by inverting the polarity of one and summing them; any remaining sound reveals differences — used by engineers to check remasters or cartridge channel balance.

**Etymology:** Electronics term — signals that are identical will *null* (cancel) when inverted and summed.

**Example:** “He ran a null-test between the needle-drop and digital master to expose EQ changes.”

**Cultural Note:** * Valuable for confirming whether reissues are true flat transfers of original masters.
