# Generation Loss

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The gradual loss of fidelity that occurs each time a tape or disc is copied from another copy instead of the original master.

**Etymology:** From audio-engineering jargon describing *loss* of quality with each *generation* of duplication.

**Example:** “That bootleg LP came from a third-gen tape — you can hear the hiss and rolled-off highs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors hunt for “master tape” or first-gen lacquer cuts to avoid generation loss.
