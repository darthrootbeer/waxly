# J-Cut (Splice Edit)

**Definition:** **noun / slang / editing term.** A style of tape or digital edit where the incoming track’s audio starts just *before* the visual or beat transition — in vinyl DJ terms, cueing the next track’s intro so it “bleeds in” under the tail of the previous.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from film-editing “J-cut,” whose audio track shape resembles the letter “J.”

**Example:** “He did a slick J-cut bringing the synth pad in before the breakbeat dropped.”

**Cultural Note:** * An advanced beat-matching and mix-transition trick carried over from film/post-production lingo.
