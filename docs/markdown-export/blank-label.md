# Blank Label

**Definition:** A vinyl record with a plain label (often white) and no printed artwork, used for promos, DJ test cuts, or underground bootlegs.

**Etymology:** Straightforward — label area left blank or stamped with minimal info.

**Example:** “I’ve got the original U.K. white-label of that rave anthem — came in a die-cut sleeve with just a sticker catalog number.”

**Cultural Note:** * Crucial to dance-music scenes (garage, jungle, techno) where DJs wanted hot tracks before official release.
