# Fidelity

**Definition:** A measure of how accurately a playback or recording system reproduces the original sound — the holy grail for audiophiles comparing pressings.

**Etymology:** From Latin *fidelis* meaning “faithful.”

**Example:** “The first-press Japanese LP has better fidelity than the thin U.S. budget re-cut.”

**Cultural Note:** * The term “hi-fi” defined the entire post-war home-audio boom and shaped record-store marketing.
