# Fletcher

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The original 1933 equal-loudness contour graph that shows how human hearing is less sensitive to bass/treble at low levels — influenced tone-control and loudness-button design on vintage amps for vinyl listening.

**Etymology:** Named after researchers Harvey Fletcher and Wilden A. Munson.

**Example:** “The loudness contour on that ’70s receiver follows the Fletcher-Munson curve to fill out the low-end at low volume.”

**Cultural Note:** * A cornerstone concept of psychoacoustics that directly impacted hi-fi hardware.
