# J-Cut Groove

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A rare cutting-lathe mishap where the groove briefly swerves sideways forming a “hook” shape, causing a click or mistrack.

**Etymology:** Named for the unintended groove path resembling a capital “J.”

**Example:** “Side-one has a tiny J-cut groove near the intro — the stylus pops every rotation.”

**Cultural Note:** * Usually confined to small sections of defective stampers — prized pressings can still suffer it.
