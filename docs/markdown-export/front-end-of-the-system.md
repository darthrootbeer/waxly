# Front-End

**Definition:** **noun / audio slang.** Refers collectively to the signal-origin components of a vinyl playback system — primarily the turntable, tonearm, and cartridge before amplification.

**Etymology:** Hi-fi shorthand for the system’s *front-end* where the signal starts.

**Example:** “Upgrade the front-end — a better cart and arm will outclass any amp swap.”

**Cultural Note:** * Audiophiles debate spending more on the front-end versus speakers for best return in vinyl setups.
