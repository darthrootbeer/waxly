# Kinetic-Balance Arm Weight

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A counterweight system designed to maintain consistent tracking force across warped records by shifting mass dynamically as the tonearm rises or falls.

**Etymology:** Engineering term for a *kinetically balanced* moving weight.

**Example:** “Some ’70s Japanese hi-fi decks sported kinetic-balance arm weights to improve warp-tracking.”

**Cultural Note:** * An early analog engineering solution that disappeared as records became flatter and arms improved.
