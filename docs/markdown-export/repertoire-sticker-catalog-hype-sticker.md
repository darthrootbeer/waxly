# Repertoire Sticker

**Definition:** **noun / retail ephemera.** A **sticker highlighting the artist’s back-catalog titles** or label’s other offerings, often on early LP shrink-wraps.

**Etymology:** *Repertoire* meaning the label’s list of works.

**Example:** “The shrink still carries a Motown repertoire sticker advertising four other Supremes LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Part of mid-century cross-promotion — often discarded by buyers, thus scarce today.
