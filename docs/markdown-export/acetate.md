# Acetate

**Definition:** A soft lacquer-coated aluminum (or occasionally glass) disc used to cut the very first playable copy of a recording straight from the mastering lathe. Acetates wear out fast — maybe 10–20 plays — but capture the freshest, most dynamic version of a track.

**Etymology:** Named for the nitrocellulose acetate lacquer layer applied over the disc’s base.

**Example:** “I scored an acetate of a lost 1972 soul demo — the paper label is handwritten in ballpoint.”

**Cultural Note:** * In the ’50s and ’60s, DJs prized acetates for breaking brand-new singles in clubs before commercial pressings existed. Jamaican sound-system culture still calls them dubplates.
