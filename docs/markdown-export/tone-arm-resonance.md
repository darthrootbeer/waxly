# [Tone](../t/tone-arm.md)-Arm Resonance

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi performance spec.** The **natural resonant frequency created by the mass of the tone-arm and the compliance of the cartridge’s cantilever suspension** — ideally falls between 8-12 Hz to avoid rumble or audible bass-boost.

**Etymology:** Audio-engineering phrase — *resonance* of the *tone-arm* + cartridge combo.

**Example:** “Matching the high-compliance cartridge to the heavy S-arm dropped the tone-arm resonance to 6 Hz — bad for warped records.”

**Cultural Note:** * Proper arm–cartridge matching is a key tweak in audiophile setups.
