# Mint

**Definition:** **noun / grading term.** A near-perfect condition grade just shy of absolute Mint; record is virtually unplayed but may show one or two hairline sleeve scuffs.

**Etymology:** Record-grading shorthand — *Mint* with a small *minus* qualifier.

**Example:** “The first-press Blue Note graded Mint-Minus — just a faint paper scuff on side two.”

**Cultural Note:** * A coveted grade in collector marketplaces, often commanding high premiums over VG+ copies.
