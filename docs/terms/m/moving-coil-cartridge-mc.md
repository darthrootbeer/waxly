# Moving-Coil Cartridge

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A phono cartridge design where the stylus moves tiny coils of wire within a fixed magnetic field — opposite of the moving-magnet design — delivering low output but exceptional transient detail.

**Etymology:** Engineering descriptor — *moving-coil* generator principle.

**Example:** “The high-end MC cartridge requires a step-up transformer or MC-capable phono stage.”

**Cultural Note:** * Favored by audiophiles chasing ultimate resolution from LP grooves.
