# Marker

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A record whose center label has handwritten DJ notes — BPM, key, or club owner’s initials — often lowering resale grade but telling a story of past use.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — label marked by *scrawl* of felt-tip or marker.

**Example:** “This disco 12-inch has a marker-scrawl label with old BPM notes — pure club relic.”

**Cultural Note:** * Some collectors cherish authentic marker-scrawled promos for the provenance.
