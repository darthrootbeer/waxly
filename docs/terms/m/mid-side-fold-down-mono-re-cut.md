# Mid-Side Fold-Down

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A mono vinyl master derived by electronically folding down the mid-side channels of a stereo mix, instead of using a dedicated mono mix.

**Etymology:** Studio term — *fold-down* using *mid-side* summing.

**Example:** “The ’70s budget mono reissue is just a mid-side fold-down of the stereo tape.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors often shun fold-downs in favor of original dedicated-mono mixes for authenticity.
