# Moving-Magnet Cartridge

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The most common phono cartridge type where a lightweight magnet moves on the cantilever inside fixed coils, generating sufficient output for standard phono stages.

**Etymology:** Literal — the *magnet moves* to induce signal.

**Example:** “That classic Shure V15 is a moving-magnet cart with smooth midrange and healthy output.”

**Cultural Note:** * Dominant consumer design since the late-1960s for cost-effective high-fidelity playback.
