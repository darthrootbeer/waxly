# Matrix Number

**Definition:** **noun / technical / collector term.** A unique alphanumeric code inscribed in the run-out area identifying the specific lacquer, mastering, or pressing batch.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from manufacturing term *matrix* meaning the master mold.

**Example:** “Match the matrix number ending ‘-A1’ to confirm this is the first lacquer cut.”

**Cultural Note:** * Decoding matrix numbers is fundamental to pressing-plant detective work and price-guide research.
