# Track-Banded LP

**Definition:** **noun / mastering style.** A **long-playing album where each track is visibly separated by a small land groove (‘band’)** — allows manual cueing to individual songs.

**Etymology:** Literal — LP sides *banded* between *tracks*.

**Example:** “Classical LPs were often un-banded, but pop LPs almost always track-banded for DJs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Banded vs. un-banded grooves often indicate target market (classical vs. pop/radio).
