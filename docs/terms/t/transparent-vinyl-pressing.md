# Transparent

**Definition:** **noun / color-vinyl format.** A **record made of fully see-through vinyl compound** (clear, tinted, or smoked) rather than opaque black.

**Etymology:** Plain — *transparent* vinyl instead of filled black PVC.

**Example:** “The transparent-vinyl pressing looks like frozen glass on the turntable.”

**Cultural Note:** * Popular with collectors and limited-edition reissues since the 1970s picture-disc boom.
