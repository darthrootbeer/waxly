# Time-Code Vinyl

**Definition:** **noun / digital-DJ medium.** A **special vinyl disc that carries a continuous control-tone signal** read by a digital-vinyl-system (DVS) interface to manipulate digital audio files as if they were on real vinyl.

**Etymology:** Tech-DJ term — vinyl encoded with *time-code*.

**Example:** “Scratch DJs practicing on Serato use time-code vinyl to control MP3 crates.”

**Cultural Note:** * Revolutionized turntablism in the 2000s by blending tactile analog skills with digital libraries.
