# Transcription Disc

**Definition:** **noun / historical broadcast format.** A **large-diameter 16-inch vinyl or lacquer disc** used from the 1930s-50s to distribute radio programs and live concerts to stations — cut at 33⅓ RPM well before the consumer LP.

**Etymology:** Broadcast-era term — discs used to *transcribe* live shows.

**Example:** “The Benny Goodman 1938 Carnegie Hall concert survives thanks to NBC transcription discs.”

**Cultural Note:** * A vital precursor to the modern LP and invaluable archive source for pre-tape broadcasts.
