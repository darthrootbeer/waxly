# Turntable Rumble

**Definition:** **noun / mechanical-noise spec.** The **low-frequency mechanical noise produced by motor or bearing transmitted into the stylus**, usually measured in dB below signal.

**Etymology:** Plain — deck’s low-end *rumble* component.

**Example:** “Replacing worn platter-bearing bushings lowered the vintage idler’s turntable rumble by 8 dB.”

**Cultural Note:** * A key quality spec that drove the move from idler- to belt- and direct-drive decks.
