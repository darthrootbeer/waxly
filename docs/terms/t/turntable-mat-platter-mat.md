# Turntable Mat

**Definition:** **noun / deck interface.** The **disc-shaped layer placed between the platter and the record** — can be rubber, felt, cork, leather, graphite, etc., affecting damping and grip.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *mat* used on the *turntable platter*.

**Example:** “Swapping the hard rubber mat for a cork-rubber blend tightened the bass on the belt-drive.”

**Cultural Note:** * A simple but audible tweak area in audiophile culture; DJs prefer felt for slip-cueing.
