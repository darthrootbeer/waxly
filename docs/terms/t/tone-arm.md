# Tone

**Definition:** **noun / turntable component.** The **pivoting or linear-tracking arm that holds the headshell & cartridge**, guiding the stylus through the groove.

**Etymology:** Literal — the arm that carries the audio *tone*.

**Example:** “Upgrading the tone-arm bearings lowered friction and revealed more micro-detail.”

**Cultural Note:** * One of the three critical mechanical elements of turntable performance alongside platter/bearing and cartridge.
