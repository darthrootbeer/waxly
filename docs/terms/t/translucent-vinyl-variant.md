# Translucent

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** A **vinyl compound that appears opaque under normal light but glows translucent ruby or amber when held to strong back-light** — common in 1980s Quiex-type pressings.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — vinyl that is *translucent*.

**Example:** “Hold the ’82 promo to the lamp — it’s that translucent-vinyl variant all the collectors chase.”

**Cultural Note:** * A beloved Easter-egg feature of many early-’80s promos and audiophile issues.
