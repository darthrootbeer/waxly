# Target

**Definition:** **noun / collector nickname.** A **1970-73 Warner/Elektra/Atlantic LP label design** featuring a bold colored “target” bullseye motif behind the logo — prized by collectors as a first-press identifier.

**Etymology:** Nickname from the label’s *target-style* graphic.

**Example:** “Early Eagles albums on the purple WEA target-label LPs often have the best sounding cuts.”

**Cultural Note:** * A major visual cue for U.S. & German first-press rock LP collectors.
