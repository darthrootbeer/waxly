# Timing Strip

**Definition:** **noun / radio-promo ephemera.** A **paper strip or sticker listing exact track timings and cue info** for announcers and DJs — usually affixed to the jacket front.

**Etymology:** Plain — a *strip* giving *timing* data.

**Example:** “The promo LP still sports its original timing-strip with DJ cues typed in.”

**Cultural Note:** * Classic feature of 1960s-80s U.S. radio-promo albums; collectors prize intact originals.
