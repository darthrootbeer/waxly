# Tone-Arm Tube Damping

**Definition:** **noun / audiophile tweak.** A **method of reducing unwanted micro-resonances inside the tone-arm wand** by injecting silicone fluid, foam, or using constrained-layer sleeves.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *damping* the hollow *tube* of the arm.

**Example:** “DIY tone-arm tube damping tamed the edgy top-end on the aluminum straight-arm.”

**Cultural Note:** * Popular tweak among modders of lightweight Japanese arms in the 1980s-90s.
