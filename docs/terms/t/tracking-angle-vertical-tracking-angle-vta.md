# Tracking Angle / Vertical Tracking Angle

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi geometry term.** The **angle at which the stylus sits in the groove relative to the record surface** — ideally matches the angle of the cutter head (~20°). Adjustable via tone-arm height.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *angle* of stylus *tracking* the groove wall.

**Example:** “Raising the arm lowered the vertical tracking angle to align with 180 g pressings.”

**Cultural Note:** * A frequent topic in audiophile cartridge alignment rituals.
