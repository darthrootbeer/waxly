# Tape-Splice Pop

**Definition:** **noun / mastering artifact.** A **tiny audible tick or bump at an analog tape-edit splice** that sometimes transfers to the lacquer if not trimmed out.

**Etymology:** Literal — audible *[pop](../p/pop.md)* at the physical *splice* in the tape.

**Example:** “You can hear a faint tape-splice pop before the second chorus — straight off the master reel.”

**Cultural Note:** * A tell-tale of analog editing techniques in classic rock & jazz productions.
