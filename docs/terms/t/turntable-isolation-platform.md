# Turntable Isolation Platform

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory.** A **dedicated stand or floating platform that decouples a turntable from floor-borne vibration** — often uses sorbothane feet, springs, or constrained-layer shelves.

**Etymology:** Functional — platform that provides *isolation* for the *turntable*.

**Example:** “A wall-mounted turntable isolation platform cured the footfall-skip problem on the suspended-floor room.”

**Cultural Note:** * Crucial tweak for vinyl playback in lively floors or high-volume listening spaces.
