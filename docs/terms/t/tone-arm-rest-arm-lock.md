# [Tone](../t/tone-arm.md)-Arm Rest

**Definition:** **noun / deck feature.** A **small cradle or clip that secures the tone-arm when not in use** — protects stylus and arm bearings during transport or dust-cover closing.

**Etymology:** Plain — a *rest* to hold the *tone-arm*.

**Example:** “Always lock the tone-arm rest before moving the turntable.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential but often-overlooked part — broken arm-locks are common on vintage decks.
