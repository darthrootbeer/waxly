# Tracking Force

**Definition:** **noun / cartridge-setup spec.** The **downward pressure in grams applied by the tone-arm to keep the stylus seated in the groove** — specified by cartridge maker.

**Etymology:** Plain — *force* with which stylus *tracks* the groove.

**Example:** “A mistracking sizzle vanished after increasing the tracking force to 1.8 g.”

**Cultural Note:** * One of the most critical basic setup specs since the earliest electric pickups.
