# Test Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing stage.** A **small batch of sample pressings** (often 5–25 copies) made from first stampers to check for defects before mass production.

**Etymology:** Industrial term: a *pressing* made purely for *testing*.

**Example:** “The white-label test-pressing includes handwritten matrix numbers and came in a plain sleeve.”

**Cultural Note:** * Highly collectible — especially if containing early mixes or different sequencing.
