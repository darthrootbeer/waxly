# Zero-Rumble Spec

**Definition:** **noun / deck spec slang.** A **marketing claim that a turntable’s measured rumble was below the instrument’s noise-floor** — common ad lingo once quartz-locked direct-drives hit -70 dB or better.

**Etymology:** Spec-sheet boast — virtually *zero* audible *rumble*.

**Example:** “JVC’s zero-rumble spec brochures became a selling point for their ‘Super DD’ decks.”

**Cultural Note:** * Part of the spec-war marketing language of the late-’70s hi-fi arms race.
