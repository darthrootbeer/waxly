# Zone-Cut / Hot-Zone Mastering

**Definition:** **noun / cutting-room slang.** A **lacquer cut optimised for a particular ‘zone’ of the disc surface** — e.g., cutting dance singles in the outer-zone only for louder grooves.

**Etymology:** Slang — track cut in a specific disc *zone* for max impact.

**Example:** “Some DJ 12-inches are zone-cut with just one loud track in the outer third of the disc.”

**Cultural Note:** * A niche but effective dance-vinyl mastering tactic.
