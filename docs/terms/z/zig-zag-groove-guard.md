# Zig-Zag Groove Guard

**Definition:** **noun / packaging-mould feature.** A **slight zig-zag raised lip pattern on some LP edges or labels designed to keep stacked records’ grooves from rubbing when sleeveless**.

**Etymology:** Visual descriptor — edge/label lip moulded with a *zig-zag* pattern acting as a *groove-guard*.

**Example:** “The early RCA Dynaflex pressings added a zig-zag groove-guard ring to protect playing surfaces in shipping.”

**Cultural Note:** * One of several experiments (groove-guard ring, raised-label ridge) in mid-century pressing plants.
