# Zip-Tone Pops

**Definition:** **noun / playback noise slang.** A **crackly ‘zip-tone’ series of static pops heard on dusty or statically charged records at needle-drop**.

**Etymology:** Onomatopoeia — sounds like a faint *zip-tone* crackle.

**Example:** “A carbon-fiber brush before play stops most zip-tone pops on dry winter days.”

**Cultural Note:** * A common nuisance in low-humidity climates; cured by anti-static cleaning and mats.
