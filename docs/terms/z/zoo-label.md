# Zoo-Label Novelty 45

**Definition:** **noun / collector nickname.** A **novelty-label 7-inch single released by small regional ‘zoo’-branded labels** in the 1950s-60s — term also loosely for any animal-mascot kids’ record label.

**Etymology:** Nick-name from colourful *zoo-themed* label logos.

**Example:** “The zoo-label novelty 45s of kiddie rockabilly are surprisingly collectible.”

**Cultural Note:** * One of many tiny regional pressing curios from the dawn of the 45 era.
