# Sintered Bronze Bearing

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi engineering term.** A **porous bronze bearing** made by powder-metal sintering, self-lubricating with oil — widely used for quiet platter and tone-arm pivots.

**Etymology:** Metallurgy term: *sintered bronze* component.

**Example:** “Replacing the dry sintered-bronze bearing sleeve reduced platter rumble dramatically.”

**Cultural Note:** * A hallmark of quality engineering in classic mid-century hi-fi turntables.
