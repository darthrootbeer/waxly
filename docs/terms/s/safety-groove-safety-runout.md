# Safety Groove

**Definition:** **noun / cutting-room term.** A **silent protective groove** cut just after the last musical groove but before the lock-groove to prevent the stylus from skating into the label.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — groove added for *safety*.

**Example:** “The lathe operator added a wide safety groove before the locked run-out.”

**Cultural Note:** * Standard best-practice in lacquer cutting since the LP era began.
