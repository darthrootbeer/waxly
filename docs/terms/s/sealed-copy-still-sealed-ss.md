# Sealed Copy / Still-Sealed

**Definition:** **noun / collector-grading term.** A **record still in its original shrink-wrap or factory seal**, presumed unplayed; often denoted **SS** in grading.

**Etymology:** Plain — copy remains *sealed*.

**Example:** “He scored a still-sealed first-press of the Blue Note classic — gamble on warp risk though.”

**Cultural Note:** * Valued by collectors, but audiophiles often open and clean even sealed vintage LPs before play.
