# Slow-Cut Lacquer

**Definition:** **noun / mastering style.** A **lacquer cut at slower lead-screw pitch** so grooves are spaced wider apart — useful for loud or bass-heavy tracks to avoid groove collisions.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — lathe’s pitch feed is *slowed* during the *cut*.

**Example:** “The reggae 12-inch used a slow-cut lacquer for maximum headroom on the dub side.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common in disco/dub reggae 12-inch culture where volume and bass punch were paramount.
