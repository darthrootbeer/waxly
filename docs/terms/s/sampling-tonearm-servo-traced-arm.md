# Sampling Tonearm

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi term.** A **servo-controlled tonearm** that “samples” groove angle and continuously adjusts to keep tangential alignment — precursor to full linear-tracking arms.

**Etymology:** *Sampling* of groove position by servo sensors.

**Example:** “That ’80s Denon deck used a sampling tonearm with an optical sensor to correct tracking error.”

**Cultural Note:** * A fascinating transitional technology in late-70s/80s Japanese hi-fi design.
