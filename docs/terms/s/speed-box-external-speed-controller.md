# Speed-Box / External Speed Controller

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory.** An **outboard electronic speed-controller** for AC-motor belt-drive turntables, enabling precise 33⅓/45 RPM switching and fine-tuning of platter speed.

**Etymology:** Marketing descriptor — *box* that controls platter *speed*.

**Example:** “The Pro-Ject deck with a Speed-Box locks speed tighter than wall-power frequency drift.”

**Cultural Note:** * A popular upgrade for mid-fi belt-drives lacking quartz-lock.
