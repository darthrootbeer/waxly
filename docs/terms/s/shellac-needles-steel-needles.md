# Shellac Needles

**Definition:** **noun / playback accessory.** **Disposable steel or bamboo needles** used in acoustic and early electric 78-RPM players. Typically changed every play to prevent groove gouging.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *needles* for shellac-era machines.

**Example:** “Always swap a fresh steel shellac needle for each disc to avoid groove damage.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential for period-correct playback on antique wind-ups; never use on vinyl LPs.
