# Shrink-Wrap

**Definition:** **noun / packaging.** A **tight plastic film heat-shrunk around retail LP jackets** to keep them factory-fresh and tamper-evident.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — [jacket](../j/jacket/) *wrapped* in heat-*shrink* film.

**Example:** “Original-shrink with hype-sticker intact boosts a first-press LP’s collector value.”

**Cultural Note:** * Became standard U.S. retail packaging in the mid-1960s; hype-stickers often attached to the wrap.
