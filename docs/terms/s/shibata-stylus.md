# Shibata Stylus

**Definition:** **noun / stylus profile.** A **line-contact stylus shape** originally designed in the early 1970s by engineer Norio Shibata for JVC’s **CD-4 quadraphonic** LPs. Its long, narrow contact patch traces groove walls more accurately than common elliptical tips.

**Etymology:** Named after **Norio Shibata**, JVC engineer who patented the shape in 1972.

**Example:** “Switching to a Shibata stylus reduced inner-groove distortion on long classical sides.”

**Cultural Note:** * Still favored by audiophiles for stereo LP playback; required for CD-4 quad LPs.
