# Shotgun Groove

**Definition:** **noun / mastering slang.** A **hot, extra-wide groove cut** to maximize volume and bass punch for club/disco singles — trades off side length for amplitude headroom.

**Etymology:** Slang — grooves look as if blasted *wide* like a *shotgun* spread.

**Example:** “The 12-inch white-label has a shotgun groove you can spot across the room.”

**Cultural Note:** * Hallmark of 1970s–80s club-oriented 12-inch mastering.
