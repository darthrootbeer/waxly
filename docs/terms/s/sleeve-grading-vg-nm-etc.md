# Sleeve Grading

**Definition:** **noun / collector practice.** The **condition rating of a record’s outer jacket or sleeve** using standard grading scales — Mint (M), Near Mint (NM), Very Good (VG), Good (G), etc.

**Etymology:** Plain — *sleeve* condition *grading*.

**Example:** “The vinyl is NM but sleeve grading drops it to VG+ due to a 1-inch seam split.”

**Cultural Note:** * Serious buyers demand accurate separate grading for vinyl vs. sleeve.
