# Sink-Mark

**Definition:** **noun / pressing defect.** A **slight concave warp** across the record face, usually caused by uneven cooling of the vinyl biscuit puck after pressing.

**Etymology:** Plant slang — center *sinks* inward during cooling.

**Example:** “The LP shows a minor sink-mark dish-warp but tracks fine under a clamp.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common QC complaint on modern heavy-weight vinyl.
