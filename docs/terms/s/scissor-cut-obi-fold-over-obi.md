# Scissor-Cut Obi

**Definition:** **noun / Japanese packaging term.** A **narrow folded paper ‘obi’ strip** that slips over the jacket edge and looks like it’s been cut by scissors — typical of late-70s/80s budget Japanese issues.

**Etymology:** Visual descriptor — *obi* strip folded with a *scissor-cut* edge.

**Example:** “The scissor-cut obi is intact — key for collectors of Japanese pop LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Obi strips (belt-like paper wraps) are central to Japanese-pressing desirability; condition often dictates value.
