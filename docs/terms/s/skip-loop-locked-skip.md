# Skip-Loop

**Definition:** **noun / [groove](../g/groove-wear.md) defect / DJ trick.** Either a **groove-damage defect that causes the stylus to loop-replay** a short segment or, in DJ use, a deliberate locked-groove sample loop.

**Etymology:** *Skip* causes a repeating *loop*.

**Example:** “The scratched disco 12-inch has a nasty skip-loop right before the breakdown.”

**Cultural Note:** * A bane of collectors, yet sometimes creatively used as live loop by hip-hop turntablists.
