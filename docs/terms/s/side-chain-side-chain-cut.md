# Side-Chain

**Definition:** **noun / mastering technique.** A **vinyl-cutting compressor/limiter controlled by a separate side-chain signal** (often the bass) to prevent groove over-modulation.

**Etymology:** Audio-engineering term *side-chain* applied to the cutting console.

**Example:** “Disco cuts often used heavy side-chain compression triggered by the kick-drum to keep bass mono and hot.”

**Cultural Note:** * A hidden but vital aspect of club-vinyl mastering engineering.
