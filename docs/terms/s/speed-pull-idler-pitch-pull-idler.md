# Speed-Pull Idler

**Definition:** **noun / vintage changer part.** A **sliding idler-wheel mechanism** that changes contact diameter on stepped motor pulley to alter platter RPM on old record changers.

**Etymology:** Mechanical — idler *pulled* to different pulley step for *speed* change.

**Example:** “The Garrard changer’s speed-pull idler needed new rubber to stop slipping at 78 RPM.”

**Cultural Note:** * A staple design in mid-century idler-drive turntables before electronic selectors.
