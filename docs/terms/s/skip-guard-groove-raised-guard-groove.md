# Skip-Guard Groove

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing tweak.** A **subtle raised lip or guard-band** between tracks on children’s or spoken-word records designed to reduce accidental needle-skips when bumped.

**Etymology:** Trade name: *skip-guard* marketed in mid-20th-century kiddie records.

**Cultural Note:** * Mostly a novelty of 1950s–70s kid-friendly pressings.
