# Seam

**Definition:** **noun / [jacket](../j/jacket.md)-grading flaw.** A **tear or separation along a jacket’s glued seam**, often from records being stored or shipped inside the jacket without protection.

**Etymology:** Literal — jacket *seam* has *split*.

**Example:** “The LP grades VG+ vinyl but only VG jacket due to a 2-inch top-seam split.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on mail-order or shrink-sealed LPs shipped with vinyl inside jacket.
