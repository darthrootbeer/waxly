# Shelf-Wear

**Definition:** **noun / grading flaw.** **Rubbing or color loss** along jacket edges, corners, or faces from years of sliding in/out of tight shelves.

**Etymology:** Literal — wear caused by storage on *shelves*.

**Example:** “Mild shelf-wear along the spine keeps the sleeve at VG+ instead of NM.”

**Cultural Note:** * Among the most common grading deductions for second-hand LP jackets.
