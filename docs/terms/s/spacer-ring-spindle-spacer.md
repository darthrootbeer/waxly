# Spacer Ring

**Definition:** **noun / hardware accessory.** A **thin ring placed over the platter spindle** to slightly raise records with raised outer lips or to help with warped discs during clamping.

**Etymology:** Functional — a *spacer* ring on the spindle.

**Example:** “Using a 3 mm spacer ring helped flatten the dished audiophile LP under the reflex clamp.”

**Cultural Note:** * Handy tweak for collectors fighting mild dish-warps.
