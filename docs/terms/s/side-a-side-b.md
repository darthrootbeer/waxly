# Side-A

**Definition:** **noun / format convention.** The **two sides of a record** — historically *Side A* hosts the featured single or first half of the LP sequence, *Side B* the flip or secondary tracks.

**Etymology:** Literal two-sided format labelling.

**Example:** “That Motown 45’s B-side sleeper hit later out-charted its A-side.”

**Cultural Note:** * Gave rise to the term “B-side hit” — beloved deep-cut culture for fans.
