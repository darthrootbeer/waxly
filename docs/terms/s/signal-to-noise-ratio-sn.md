# Signal-to-Noise Ratio

**Definition:** **noun / audio-spec term.** A measurement comparing the **desired music signal** level to the **background [noise](../n/noise-floor.md)** of the playback chain — expressed in decibels (dB). Higher numbers mean cleaner playback.

**Etymology:** Engineering term: ratio of *signal* to *noise*.

**Example:** “That direct-drive deck with low-rumble motor improved the signal-to-noise ratio to 70 dB.”

**Cultural Note:** * A core spec in hi-fi turntable and pre-amp design since the early stereo boom.
