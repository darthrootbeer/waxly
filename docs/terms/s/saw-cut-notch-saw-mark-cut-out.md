# Saw-Cut Notch

**Definition:** **noun / retail remainder mark.** A **thin saw-blade cut in the LP jacket’s spine or edge** to indicate remaindered or discounted stock — akin to punch-hole and cut-corner marks.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — jacket sliced with a *saw-cut notch*.

**Example:** “The import has a small saw-cut notch near the barcode but the vinyl is mint.”

**Cultural Note:** * Ubiquitous in 1970s-90s clearance bins; sometimes first-press copies ended up remaindered this way.
