# Shellac Disc

**Definition:** **noun / historical format.** A **pre-vinyl disc** made of shellac and mineral filler, usually **10-inch 78 RPM** records produced from the 1890s through early 1950s. Brittle, heavy, and groove-wide (≈ 3 mil).

**Etymology:** Material-based — discs made of *shellac* resin.

**Example:** “Collectors use a 3-mil stylus and heavier tracking force for vintage shellac discs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Dominant commercial format before the LP era; still prized by early-jazz/blues collectors.
