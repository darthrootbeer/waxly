# Speed-Change Knob

**Definition:** **noun / deck control.** A **manual or electronic switch that selects 33⅓, 45, or 78 RPM** on a turntable.

**Etymology:** Functional — control to *change speed*.

**Example:** “Vintage idler-drive changers often hide the speed-change knob under the platter rim.”

**Cultural Note:** * Some audiophile decks delete the 78 option, prompting aftermarket pulley swaps.
