# In-Store Play Copy

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A record kept by a shop specifically for demonstration on the store turntable so customers could sample albums before buying.

**Etymology:** Retail slang — a copy meant for *in-store play.*

**Cultural Note:** * Common in mid-century record shops and department stores; some stamped copies became collectible variants.
