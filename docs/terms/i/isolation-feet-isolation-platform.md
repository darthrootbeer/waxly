# Isolation Feet

**Definition:** Shock-absorbing feet or platforms placed under turntables or amps to minimize vibration from floors, speakers, or footsteps.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — devices that *isolate* gear via special *feet* or a platform.

**Example:** “Add Sorbothane isolation feet to tame foot-fall feedback on that suspended-floor rack.”

**Cultural Note:** * Became popular in the ’80s-’90s as vinyl audiophiles chased lower noise floors.
