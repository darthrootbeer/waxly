# Intermodulation Distortion

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A type of distortion created when two or more frequencies interact non-linearly in cartridge, amplifier, or speaker, producing unwanted sum-and-difference tones.

**Etymology:** Engineering term — *inter-modulation* of signals creating spurious components.

**Example:** “Excessive tracking force can raise intermodulation distortion on complex brass passages.”

**Cultural Note:** * A key spec scrutinized by hi-fi magazines during the ’70s vinyl equipment wars.
