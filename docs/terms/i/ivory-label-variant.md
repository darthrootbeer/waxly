**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A collector nickname for certain pressings distinguished by a pale ivory-colored label background — often limited to early or export runs.

**Etymology:** Descriptive of its *ivory* label color.

**Example:** “Hunt the ivory-label variant — it’s the true first-press before they switched to silver.”

**Cultural Note:** * Such label-color changes can signal rare first-runs that fetch premium prices.
