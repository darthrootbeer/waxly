# Inner-Sleeve Rash

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A cloudy or mottled vinyl surface pattern caused by reaction with cheap PVC or acidic paper inner sleeves — usually cosmetic but sometimes noisy.

**Etymology:** Collector slang likening the cloudy marks to a skin *rash.*

**Example:** “That ’80s new-wave LP shows mild inner-sleeve rash from decades in PVC liners.”

**Cultural Note:** * One reason collectors replace vintage PVC or acidic sleeves with modern archival ones.
