# Italian Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** Any record manufactured in Italy — often identifiable by label fonts, SIAE stamp, or unique laminated sleeves; sometimes praised for warm mastering on ’70s prog and film-score LPs.

**Etymology:** Straightforward — a *pressing* from *Italy.*

**Example:** “The Italian pressing of that Morricone soundtrack has a more cinematic low-end than the U.S. cut.”

**Cultural Note:** * Highly collected for Euro-prog, library music, and spaghetti-western soundtracks.
