# Hand-Etched Matrix

**Definition:** A matrix/run-out inscription scratched by hand into the lacquer by the mastering engineer — often includes initials or pressing info.

**Etymology:** Plain description: the *matrix number* is *hand-etched.*

**Example:** “Look for the hand-etched ‘Porky Prime Cut’ in the dead-wax — that’s George Peckham’s signature.”

**Cultural Note:** * Many legendary engineers left playful etchings — secret signatures that became collector folklore.
