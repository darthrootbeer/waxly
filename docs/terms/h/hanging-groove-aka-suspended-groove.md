# Hanging Groove

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A pressing defect where the spiral briefly stalls and nearly loops before resuming its inward path — can cause a repeating click or short loop.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — the groove seems to *hang* in place.

**Example:** “Side B has a nasty hanging groove right before the guitar solo — it keeps ticking in time with the loop.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on budget or worn stampers; dreaded by archivists transferring rare LPs.
