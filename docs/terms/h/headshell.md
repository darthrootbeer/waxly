# Headshell

**Definition:** The detachable mount at the end of many S-shaped tonearms that holds the cartridge and stylus; secured by a bayonet or screw-mount.

**Etymology:** Literal — the *shell* at the tonearm’s *head.*

**Example:** “Swap the stock headshell for a lighter magnesium one to better match the new cartridge compliance.”

**Cultural Note:** * The universal SME-type bayonet headshell enabled quick cartridge swaps for DJs and hi-fi tinkerers alike.
