# Hot Cut

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A record cut with higher-than-normal groove amplitude for maximum loudness and punch — common on club 12-inch singles and some early rock LPs.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — lacquer was cut *hot* (loud).

**Example:** “The RL-cut *Led Zeppelin II* is a legendary hot-cut that slams but risks inner-groove distortion.”

**Cultural Note:** * Part of the disco-era loudness wars; prized by DJs for cutting through club PAs.
