# Hand-Numbered Edition

**Definition:** A limited-press vinyl release individually numbered by hand on the jacket or insert — a common tactic for boutique or crowdfunding runs.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — each copy is literally *hand-numbered.*

**Example:** “Snagged copy #37/300 of the neon-splatter EP — hand-numbered in silver ink on the back.”

**Cultural Note:** * Became a hallmark of punk-DIY labels and Record-Store-Day collector culture.
