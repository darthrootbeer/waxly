# Hi-Fi (High-Fidelity)

**Definition:** **noun / slang / marketing.** A term describing audio equipment capable of accurate, high-quality sound reproduction; became synonymous with serious home-stereo gear in the LP era.

**Etymology:** Shortened from *high-fidelity* — “faithful to the source.”

**Example:** “Dad’s 1965 console stereo proudly sported a chrome ‘Hi-Fi’ badge on the lid.”

**Cultural Note:** * “Hi-Fi” was the aspirational buzzword of the ’50s–’70s, fueling the stereo-craze and hi-fi clubs.
