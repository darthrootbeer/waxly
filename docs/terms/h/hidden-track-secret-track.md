# Hidden Track

**Definition:** An unlisted song placed after the last listed track — often hidden in the run-out groove or following a span of silence at side’s end.

**Etymology:** Self-explanatory — a track intentionally *hidden.*

**Example:** “The U.K. pressing hides a goofy studio jam as a hidden track locked after the fade-out.”

**Cultural Note:** * A favorite Easter-egg tradition of alternative-rock and punk LPs in the ’80s-’90s.
