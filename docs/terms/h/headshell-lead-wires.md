# Headshell Lead Wires

**Definition:** Four tiny color-coded wires (L+, L–, R+, R–) that connect the cartridge pins to the headshell contacts — a common upgrade path for audiophiles chasing better conductivity.

**Etymology:** Literal — *lead wires* attached to the *headshell.*

**Example:** “Replace brittle stock headshell leads with oxygen-free copper for a slight clarity bump.”

**Cultural Note:** * A rite-of-passage tweak in the vinyl-DIY hobby.
