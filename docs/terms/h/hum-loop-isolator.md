# Hum-Loop Isolator

**Definition:** **noun / device.** A small transformer-based adapter inserted in the audio path to break ground-loops that cause hum between turntable and amplifier.

**Etymology:** Literal — device that *isolates* the *hum loop.*

**Example:** “Add a hum-loop isolator between the DJ mixer and powered speakers to kill that buzz.”

**Cultural Note:** * A must-have in many bar/club vinyl installations plagued by dirty mains power.
