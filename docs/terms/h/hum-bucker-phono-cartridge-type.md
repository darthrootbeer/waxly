# Hum-Bucker

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A cartridge or wiring configuration designed to cancel out electromagnetic hum by using two coils wired in opposite polarity.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from electric-guitar *humbucker* pickup design.

**Example:** “The old GE VR-II mono cart was an early hum-bucker design for radio-station quietness.”

**Cultural Note:** * Important in early broadcast/AM-radio days when turntables sat near transformers and lighting ballasts.
