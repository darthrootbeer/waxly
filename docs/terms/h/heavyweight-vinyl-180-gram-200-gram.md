# Heavyweight Vinyl

**Definition:** **noun / marketing term.** Records pressed on thicker, heavier PVC biscuit — typically 180 g or 200 g — marketed for improved stability, flatter profiles, and premium feel.

**Etymology:** Descriptive of *heavier-weight* vinyl compound.

**Example:** “The 200-gram heavyweight vinyl edition feels like a manhole cover compared to the ’80s thin-wax copy.”

**Cultural Note:** * A 1990s-2000s audiophile trend that stuck as a marketing shorthand for quality.
