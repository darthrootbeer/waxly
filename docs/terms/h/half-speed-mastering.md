# Half-Speed Mastering

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A mastering process where the lacquer is cut at half the normal playback speed (16⅔ RPM for a 33⅓ LP). This lets the cutting head trace high-frequency detail more accurately, reducing distortion and improving transient response.

**Etymology:** Literal — the lacquer is *mastered* while the lathe spins at *half-speed.*

**Example:** “The Abbey Road half-speed mastering of that Police album reveals more shimmer in the cymbals.”

**Cultural Note:** * A prized audiophile selling point in the late ’70s and a revived premium option today.
