# Hard-Bop Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Jazz-collector shorthand for original mid-’50s–early-’60s LPs from the hard-bop era on labels like Blue Note, Prestige, Riverside — especially those with deep-groove labels and RVG mastering.

**Etymology:** From the *hard-bop* jazz style plus *pressing.*

**Example:** “That hard-bop pressing of Art Blakey’s *Moanin’* with the ear-mark label is worth four figures.”

**Cultural Note:** * The crown jewels of jazz vinyl collecting — condition and provenance drive huge auction prices.
