# Equal-Loudness Curve

**Definition:** A frequency-response graph (e.g., Fletcher-Munson) showing how human hearing perceives bass/treble at different volumes — influences mastering and tone-control design for vinyl playback.

**Etymology:** Describes curves of *equal perceived loudness.*

**Example:** “Old loudness buttons on receivers boost bass per the equal-loudness curve to compensate for low-volume listening.”

**Cultural Note:** * Part of why vintage receivers have “loudness” switches beloved by late-night LP listeners.
