# Edge

**Definition:** A common vinyl defect where only the outer rim of a disc warps upward or downward, usually from heat or bad storage.

**Etymology:** Literal — warp along the disc’s *edge.*

**Example:** “That rare soul 45 has a slight edge-warp but still plays without skips.”

**Cultural Note:** * Often fixable with flattening machines or glass-plate oven methods — though risky for prized LPs.
