# Elliptical Stylus

**Definition:** A stylus tip shaped like a tiny ellipse rather than a sphere, allowing better contact with groove walls for higher-frequency tracking and reduced distortion.

**Etymology:** Named for its *elliptical* cross-section.

**Example:** “Upgrading to an elliptical stylus cleared up the inner-groove sibilance on my jazz LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Became the audiophile standard for LP playback from the late ’60s onward.
