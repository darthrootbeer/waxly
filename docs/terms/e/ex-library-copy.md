# Ex-Library Copy

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A second-hand record deaccessioned from a public or school library collection — usually marked by stickers, stamps, or catalog cards.

**Etymology:** An evolution of the standard 45 adapter — designed to *flip over* for convenience on changer turntables.

**Example:** “That old Garrard still has its original flip-over 45 RPM adapter tucked under the mat.”

**Cultural Note:** * A mid-century hi-fi curiosity, now sought after by console-stereo restorers.
