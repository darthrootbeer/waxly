# Edison Disc

**Definition:** **noun / historical.** A vertically-cut, thick disc record format (80 RPM, ¼-inch thick) invented by Thomas Edison in 1912 as a rival to lateral-cut 78s.

**Etymology:** Named after Thomas Edison’s company and format.

**Example:** “That antique cabinet still has Edison discs — you’ll need a special reproducer to play them.”

**Cultural Note:** * Faded out by the 1930s but remains a niche interest for early-recording collectors.
