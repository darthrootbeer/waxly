# E.Q. (Equalization)

**Definition:** **noun / abbreviation.** The process of adjusting frequency balance during recording, mastering, or playback to achieve the desired tonal curve. Every vinyl record requires a specific playback EQ — usually the RIAA curve — to restore proper bass and treble.

**Etymology:** Short for *equalization* — balancing frequencies.

**Example:** “If the phono stage isn’t applying the RIAA E.Q. curve, your LPs will sound thin and tinny.”

**Cultural Note:** * Before RIAA standardization (1954), labels used competing EQ curves, making pre-’55 discs tricky for archivists.
