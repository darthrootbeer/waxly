# Eight-Track

**Definition:** A continuous-loop magnetic-tape cartridge format popular in cars during the ’60s-’70s; often issued alongside LPs for portable listening.

**Etymology:** Named for its eight parallel magnetic tracks.

**Example:** “The album dropped on vinyl, cassette, and eight-track the same week in ’74.”

**Cultural Note:** * Though not vinyl, it shaped how labels marketed albums across formats.
