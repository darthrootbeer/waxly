# Etching (Run

**Definition:** Hand-scratched marks, initials, or messages in the dead-wax/run-out area identifying mastering engineers or adding hidden notes.

**Etymology:** Literal — *etched* into the lacquer before plating.

**Example:** “Look for ‘RL’ etching in the run-out — that’s Ludwig’s hot-cut master.”

**Cultural Note:** * A secret handshake among collectors — sometimes humorous (“Do What Thou Wilt” on early Zep III pressings).
