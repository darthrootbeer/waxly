# EP (Extended Play)

**Definition:** A record release longer than a single but shorter than a full LP — often 3-6 songs. Commonly a 7-inch at 33⅓ RPM or a 12-inch with shorter runtime.

**Etymology:** Abbreviation of *Extended Play.*

**Example:** “The debut EP ran four tracks on a 7-inch 33⅓ that spun at 45 RPM overseas.”

**Cultural Note:** * A favorite format for punk and indie bands — affordable yet substantial for first releases.
