# Permanent Marker Groove

**Definition:** **noun / club-DJ hack / slang.** Marking a small dot or line on the vinyl’s surface (outside lead-in) with a Sharpie to locate cue points visually in low-light booths — risky but common in some scenes.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *permanent-marker* used as a *groove-check* guide.

**Example:** “The house DJ left a permanent-marker groove-check on every hot cue spot.”

**Cultural Note:** * A practical but frowned-upon method for fast cueing before sticker dots became the norm.
