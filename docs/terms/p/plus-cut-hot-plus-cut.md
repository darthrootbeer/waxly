# Plus-Cut

**Definition:** **noun / mastering slang.** A colloquial term for an aggressively loud cut where engineers pushed groove amplitude beyond standard specs — prized by DJs for punch but risky for tracking.

**Etymology:** *Plus* signifying “above-standard” cutting level.

**Example:** “That plus-cut disco twelve looks like canyon grooves — needs a strong cart to track cleanly.”

**Cultural Note:** * Part of the arms-race in disco and dance-music mastering during the late ’70s-’80s.
