# Pressing Plant Code

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** An alphanumeric mark — etched, stamped, or printed on label/run-out — identifying the factory that manufactured the record.

**Etymology:** [Industrial](../i/industrial.md): a *code* assigned to each *pressing plant*.

**Example:** “The ‘─P’ run-out pressing plant code confirms it came from Columbia’s Pitman, NJ plant.”

**Cultural Note:** * Key for pressing-variation hunters who track sonic differences among plants.
