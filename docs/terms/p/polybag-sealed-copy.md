# Polybag

**Definition:** **noun / retail / collector term.** A new LP originally packaged in a loose outer polybag rather than shrink-wrap — typical of many Japanese and some audiophile labels.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — LP *sealed* by a *polybag*.

**Example:** “The ’70s ECM imports came as polybag-sealed copies with hype stickers on the bag, not the jacket.”

**Cultural Note:** * Identifying an intact original polybag can help date certain imports and jazz titles.
