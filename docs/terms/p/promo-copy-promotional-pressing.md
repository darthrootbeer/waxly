# Promo Copy

**Definition:** **noun / retail & radio practice.** A record manufactured for free distribution to radio DJs, reviewers, or stores, often marked **“Promotional Copy — Not For Sale”**, sometimes with unique mono mixes or hot-cut lacquers.

**Etymology:** From *promotional* distribution pressing.

**Example:** “The white-label promo copy of that soul 45 runs a hotter DJ-friendly cut than the stock single.”

**Cultural Note:** * Highly collectible when it contains radio-only edits or earlier lacquer cuts.
