# Pre-RIAA EQ Curve

**Definition:** **noun / historical technical.** Any of the numerous EQ playback curves used by labels before the universal RIAA curve was standardized in 1955.

**Etymology:** Literally EQ curves *pre-*dating *RIAA*.

**Example:** “That early Columbia LP needs the correct pre-RIAA EQ curve or it sounds thin and tinny.”

**Cultural Note:** * Archivists rely on variable-EQ phono stages to play 1940s–early-’50s discs correctly.
