# Plug-In Headshell

**Definition:** **noun / tonearm part.** A detachable cartridge-mounting shell that plugs into an S-shaped tonearm with a bayonet or SME-type connector, allowing fast cartridge swaps.

**Etymology:** Literal — headshell designed to *plug-in* via quick-connect collar.

**Example:** “Keep spare plug-in headshells pre-mounted with DJ and mono cartridges for quick changes.”

**Cultural Note:** * Standard on Technics SL-1200 and many classic Japanese hi-fi arms.
