# Patch

**Definition:** **noun / technical / slang.** A low-frequency hum or buzz caused by faulty or poorly shielded patch cables between turntable, mixer, or preamp.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — hum traced to the *patch-cable*.

**Example:** “Swap that patch-cable — the hum disappears when you wiggle the connector.”

**Cultural Note:** * A common troubleshooting headache in DJ booths and home hi-fi racks.
