# Pencil

**Definition:** **noun / grading / ephemera.** A record whose center label bears light pencil writing (price, initials, catalog #) — usually removable and less devaluing than ink marker.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — label marked in *pencil*.

**Example:** “A faint pencil-marked label shows the shop’s 1960s price — easy to erase.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on second-hand finds from thrift bins and vintage shop stock.
