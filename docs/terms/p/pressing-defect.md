# Pressing Defect

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing term.** A general catch-all for any physical flaw created during the record-pressing cycle — e.g., non-fill, stitching, off-center hole, bubbles, scuffs, warps.

**Etymology:** Plain industrial phrase: flaw born in the *pressing* stage.

**Example:** “Return the LP — it’s riddled with pressing defects including edge-warp and a bubble under track 3.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors often distinguish **pressing defect** (plant’s fault) from **handling damage** (store or owner).
