# Pirated Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / illicit.** An unauthorized, illegally duplicated pressing intended to mimic an official release without rights-holder approval.

**Etymology:** From *pirate* = illicit copier + *pressing.*

**Example:** “That pirated pressing uses blurred artwork and plays from a noisy needle-drop source.”

**Cultural Note:** * A major issue in international black-market distribution during vinyl’s peak decades.
