# Pre-Echo (Groove-Print-Through)

**Definition:** **noun / technical artifact.** A faint “ghost” of a loud musical passage heard about 1.8 seconds before it actually starts — caused by groove wall vibrations imprinting adjacent grooves during cutting or plating.

**Etymology:** Literally a brief *echo* heard *pre-*maturely.

**Example:** “The ballad’s quiet intro reveals a slight pre-echo of the next cymbal crash.”

**Cultural Note:** * A quirk of the vinyl medium; collectors often accept it as part of the analog charm.
