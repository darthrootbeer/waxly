# Platter Mat

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory.** A thin mat of rubber, felt, cork, leather, or acrylic placed on the turntable platter to cushion the record, reduce vibration, and influence static and tonal character.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — a *mat* covering the platter surface.

**Example:** “Swap the stock rubber platter mat for cork to cut static and tighten bass.”

**Cultural Note:** * An inexpensive tweak audiophiles debate endlessly; DJs often use felt slip-mats for cue-spins.
