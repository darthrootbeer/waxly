# Pitch Control

**Definition:** **noun / DJ / hi-fi feature.** A slider or knob on turntables that adjusts platter speed slightly faster or slower than standard RPM — vital for beat-matching in DJ work.

**Etymology:** Controls the playback *pitch* (speed) of the record.

**Example:** “Ride the pitch control to sync that disco track’s BPM with the next one.”

**Cultural Note:** * A defining feature of the Technics SL-1200 and all professional DJ decks.
