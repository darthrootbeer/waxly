# Price-Code Sticker

**Definition:** **noun / retail ephemera.** A small printed sticker or box on the jacket showing the label’s internal price code — used by shops for inventory tiers.

**Etymology:** Retail term — label-assigned *price code*.

**Example:** “The French Polydor sleeve still shows its original ‘⟶ Prix Code U’ price-code sticker.”

**Cultural Note:** * A tiny but useful clue for dating European pressings and jacket variants.
