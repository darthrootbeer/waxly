# Punch-Hole Cut-Out

**Definition:** **noun / retail practice.** A small hole punched through the LP jacket corner or barcode to mark it as discounted **cut-out stock**, no longer returnable by the retailer.

**Etymology:** Literal — jacket physically *punched* to mark *cut-out* status.

**Example:** “The bargain-bin punch-hole cut-out copies were often from the very first lacquer run.”

**Cultural Note:** * Cut-out holes, notches, or saw-marks became ubiquitous in ’70s–’80s clearance LP culture.
