# Penny-Weight

**Definition:** **noun / DIY slang.** Adding a coin (often a penny) atop the headshell to increase tracking force for skipping or worn records — a common home-user hack, not recommended for valuable vinyl.

**Etymology:** Literal — using a *penny* as extra *weight*.

**Example:** “Grandpa’s console changer still had a taped penny-weight on the tonearm.”

**Cultural Note:** * A notorious old-school fix-it trick for cheap ceramic-cartridge players.
