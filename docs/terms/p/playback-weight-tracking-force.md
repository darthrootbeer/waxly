# Playback Weight

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The downward pressure, measured in grams, that the tonearm exerts on the stylus as it tracks the groove. Correct tracking force prevents mistracking and minimizes groove wear.

**Etymology:** Plain audio-engineering term — *weight* applied during *playback*.

**Example:** “Set the playback weight to 1.8 g as recommended for that micro-line stylus.”

**Cultural Note:** * A critical adjustment every turntable owner should learn — typically done with a tonearm counterweight or digital gauge.
