# [Playback Wear](../p/playback-wear/)

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** Cumulative [groove](../g/groove-wear/) damage caused by repeated plays, especially with heavy or worn styli — manifests as hiss, distortion, or loss of high-end detail.

**Etymology:** Literal — groove *wear* from repeated *playback.*

**Example:** “The thrift-store LP shows audible playback wear from decades on a console changer with a ceramic cart.”

**Cultural Note:** * A major factor in grading older records — can’t be fixed or polished out once the groove walls are worn.
