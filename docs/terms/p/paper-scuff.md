# Paper Scuff

**Definition:** **noun / grading term.** A light, superficial mark on a record’s surface caused by sliding in and out of a paper sleeve — rarely audible but affects visual grade.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — a *scuff* caused by *paper* contact.

**Example:** “The LP is visually VG+ due to some minor paper scuffs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on decades-old LPs stored in unlined sleeves.
