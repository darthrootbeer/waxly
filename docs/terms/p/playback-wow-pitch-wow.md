# Playback WOW

**Definition:** **noun / defect.** A slow, cyclical pitch variation (wow) audible on sustained notes, often caused by off-center pressings, warped discs, or unstable turntable speed.

**Etymology:** Hi-fi term *wow* describing slow pitch wobble.

**Example:** “The sustained organ note reveals heavy playback wow — probably an off-center side.”

**Cultural Note:** * An old enemy of audiophiles — still scrutinized on belt-drive turntables and piano-heavy recordings.
