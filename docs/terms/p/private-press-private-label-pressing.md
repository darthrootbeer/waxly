# Private-Press

**Definition:** **noun / cultural / collector term.** A small-batch record self-funded by an artist, school, or local group and manufactured by a commercial plant outside the major-label system.

**Etymology:** Literally a record *pressed* on a *private* basis.

**Example:** “That rural Ohio private-press psych-folk LP had only 200 copies made and is a grail today.”

**Cultural Note:** * A vast, eccentric realm beloved by crate-diggers for unpolished regional soul, jazz, gospel, psych, and high-school-band albums.
