# Plain

**Definition:** **noun / packaging / collector term.** A 7-inch single sold in a generic company-logo or blank paper sleeve rather than a custom picture sleeve.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — a *plain sleeve* instead of picture art.

**Example:** “The U.K. plain-sleeve 45 version is cheaper than the rare full-color picture-sleeve issue.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common for jukebox or budget singles; picture sleeves often more collectible.
