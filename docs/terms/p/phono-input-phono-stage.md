# Phono Input

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** An amplifier input with the specialized equalization and gain required for magnetic-cartridge signals; often labeled “[PHONO](../p/phono-stage-hum/)” on vintage receivers.

**Etymology:** From *phonograph* input.

**Example:** “Plug the turntable into the phono input — a line input won’t have RIAA EQ or enough gain.”

**Cultural Note:** * Once standard on all stereo receivers; now often an external box in modern hi-fi setups.
