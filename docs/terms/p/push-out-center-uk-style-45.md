# Push-Out Center

**Definition:** **noun / hardware feature.** A removable center section on many U.K./European 45 RPM singles that could be *pushed-out* for jukebox play.

**Etymology:** Literal — center piece can be *pushed-out*.

**Example:** “Collectors pay more for U.K. 45s with the original push-out center intact.”

**Cultural Note:** * Historic feature of European 45 RPM production — different from U.S. dinked centers.
