# Promo Stamp

**Definition:** **noun / retail ephemera.** A retail-stock jacket stamped or gold-foiled **PROMOTION ONLY / NOT FOR RESALE** to designate it as a free promo.

**Etymology:** Straightforward — jacket bears a *promo stamp*.

**Example:** “A gold-stamp promo of the debut LP often sells for more than the cut-out reissue.”

**Cultural Note:** * A major part of ’70s–’80s radio-promo culture — often the earliest run of that title.
