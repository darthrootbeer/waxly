# Pressing Ring

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** A circular ridge or indent left on the paper label by the center-dome of the press; diameter often reveals which plant or era made the record.

**Etymology:** Physical *ring-shaped* impression from the *pressing* die.

**Example:** “Early deep-groove Blue Notes have a wide 1½-inch pressing ring compared with later Liberty-era copies.”

**Cultural Note:** * A classic forensic detail for authenticating first-press jazz LPs.
