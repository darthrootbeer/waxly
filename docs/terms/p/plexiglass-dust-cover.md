# Plexiglass Dust

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory / vintage.** A rigid transparent lid made from plexiglass or acrylic that protects the turntable from dust — synonymous with Perspex covers but often U.S.-market term.

**Etymology:** Brand-derived generic: *Plexiglass* + *dust-cover.*

**Example:** “The vintage Dual deck still has its original smoked-plexiglass dust-cover intact.”

**Cultural Note:** * A key cosmetic feature of mid-century console and component turntables.
