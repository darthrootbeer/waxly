# Picture Disc

**Definition:** **noun / decorative pressing.** A record pressed with an image or artwork embedded beneath a clear vinyl playing surface — prized for visuals rather than sonic purity.

**Etymology:** Literal — a *disc* featuring a printed *picture.*

**Example:** “The KISS picture-disc LP looks great on the wall but plays with a bit more surface noise.”

**Cultural Note:** * Mass-market craze in late-1970s–’80s; still popular for collectible soundtracks and colored-vinyl runs.
