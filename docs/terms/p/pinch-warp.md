# Pinch

**Definition:** **noun / defect.** A small crescent-shaped warp at the record’s edge caused by uneven cooling during pressing — often creates audible “thump” each revolution.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — edge *warp* formed by *pinch* pressure of press plates.

**Example:** “You can spot a pinch-warp by the brief upward dip at one edge of the LP.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common QC flaw in bargain-bin pressings or heat-stressed shipments.
