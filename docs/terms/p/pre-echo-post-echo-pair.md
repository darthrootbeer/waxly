# Pre-Echo

**Definition:** **noun / technical artifact.** Twin phenomena — **pre-echo** is heard just before a loud transient; **post-echo** lingers just after — both result from groove or tape print-through.

**Etymology:** Describes echoes occurring *before* or *after* loud events.

**Example:** “The remaster reduced the pre-/post-echo artifacts audible on original hot-cut lacquers.”

**Cultural Note:** * More common on thin or tightly packed early stereo LPs.
