# Parallel

**Definition:** **noun / technical / hi-fi.** Another term for a **linear-tracking tonearm**, designed to move straight across the record’s radius to reduce tracking-angle error.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — the tonearm tracks *parallel* to the groove tangent.

**Example:** “The parallel-tracking arm glides on rails for precise geometry across the record.”

**Cultural Note:** * A high-end design embraced by 1970s–’80s audiophile turntables.
