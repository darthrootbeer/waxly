# Pressing Weight

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing spec.** The target gram-weight of each vinyl disc set by the plant — heavier pressings are stiffer and sometimes marketed as “audiophile 180 gram.”

**Etymology:** Literal — *weight* of the vinyl blank used in the *pressing*.

**Example:** “The reissue boasts a 180 g pressing weight but the original ’70s copy was around 140 g.”

**Cultural Note:** * An enduring marketing hook since the ’90s audiophile-reissue boom.
