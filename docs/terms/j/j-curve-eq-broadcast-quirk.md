# J-Curve EQ

**Definition:** **noun / technical slang.** A non-standard early-broadcast equalization curve used by some European stations pre-RIAA, reputedly shaped like the letter “J” on frequency graphs — today mainly an archivist’s footnote.

**Etymology:** From its *J-shaped* EQ curve response.

**Example:** “Old acetates from that station need J-curve EQ playback to sound right.”

**Cultural Note:** * A reminder of the Wild-West era of EQ standards before worldwide RIAA adoption mid-’50s.
