# Jacket

**Definition:** The outer cardboard cover that houses a vinyl record and its inner sleeve. Often features the album’s artwork, spine title, liner notes, and catalog info.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from clothing — the protective *jacket* for a record.

**Example:** “The jacket’s still crisp and square — no seam splits despite forty years on the shelf.”

**Cultural Note:** * The album jacket transformed records into visual art objects — fueling the golden age of LP cover design in the 1960s-80s.
