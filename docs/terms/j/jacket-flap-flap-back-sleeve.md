# Jacket Flap

**Definition:** A jacket whose rear cover edges are folded over and glued on top of the back artwork, leaving visible “flaps.” Common on early U.K. and European LPs.

**Etymology:** Describes the *flaps* of card folded over.

**Example:** “Collectors look for intact laminate on those ’60s flap-back sleeves — they’re prone to peeling.”

**Cultural Note:** * A tell-tale construction style for early Parlophone, Decca, and Columbia U.K. LPs.
