# Jitter (Digital

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** Minute timing errors in a digital source’s clock signal that can subtly blur transients when cut to lacquer — an audiophile concern for digitally mastered vinyl.

**Etymology:** Engineering term for irregular *jitter* in clock pulses.

**Example:** “Some purists claim high-end DACs reduce jitter artifacts before the vinyl lacquer stage.”

**Cultural Note:** * One battleground in the analog-vs-digital vinyl debate of the 2000s-present reissue boom.
