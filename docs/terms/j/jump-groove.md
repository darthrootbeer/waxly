# Jump

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** When the stylus unintentionally hops across one or more grooves — either forward or backward — often due to warps or vibration; similar to groove-jump.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — the needle *jumps* the *groove.*

**Example:** “The scratched 12-inch jump-grooves every time the bass hits.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common bane of DJs in vibrating club booths and of worn household turntables with light tracking.
