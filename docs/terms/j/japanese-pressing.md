# Japanese Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** Any vinyl record manufactured in Japan, renowned for meticulous QC, quiet virgin-vinyl compound, and often warmer mastering choices.

**Etymology:** Literal — a *pressing* made in *Japan.*

**Example:** “The Japanese pressing of that Fleetwood Mac LP is dead-quiet between tracks and comes with an obi-strip.”

**Cultural Note:** * Coveted for jazz, city-[pop](../p/pop.md), and ’70s-’80s rock titles; obi-strip intactness greatly affects resale value.
