# K-Tel Compilation

**Definition:** **noun / cultural.** Mass-market TV-advertised compilation LPs and 8-tracks released by K-Tel International in the ’70s-’80s — famous for cramming many chart hits per side at reduced groove spacing.

**Etymology:** Brand name *K-Tel* became synonymous with cheap compilation records.

**Example:** “The grooves on that disco K-Tel compilation look like pencil-thin tracks — they squeezed 12 songs per side.”

**Cultural Note:** * A nostalgic artifact of late-night TV commercials and kids’ first pop-hit LPs.
