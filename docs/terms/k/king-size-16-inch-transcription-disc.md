# King-Size 16-Inch Transcription Disc

**Definition:** **noun / historical.** A large, usually 16-inch diameter disc used by radio stations from the 1930s-1950s to distribute pre-recorded programs and live big-band performances.

**Etymology:** Nicknamed *king-size* for being far larger than commercial 10- or 12-inch records.

**Example:** “The WWII-era king-size transcription discs spin at 33⅓ RPM but need a special wide-groove stylus.”

**Cultural Note:** * An important bridge technology between shellac 78s and the microgroove LP.
