# Kick-Drum Cut

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A 12-inch single mastered with extra-wide grooves and deep EQ emphasis on the kick-drum for powerful club play.

**Etymology:** Dance-producer slang — the *cut* accentuates the *kick-drum.*

**Example:** “That Chicago-house white-label is a monster kick-drum cut — rattles the subwoofers.”

**Cultural Note:** * A hallmark of late-’80s/’90s house and techno 12-inches for underground club DJs.
