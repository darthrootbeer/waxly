# Knock-Out Center

**Definition:** **noun / slang / historical.** A detachable perforated center piece on many European 45-RPM singles that could be “knocked-out” to fit large-spindle jukeboxes.

**Etymology:** Literal — the center ring can be *knocked-out.*

**Example:** “That U.K. soul 7-inch still has its intact knock-out center — never jukeboxed.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors value intact centers; DJs often knocked them out for club and jukebox play.
