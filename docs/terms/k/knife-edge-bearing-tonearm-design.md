# Knife-Edge Bearing

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A precision tonearm-pivot design where the arm rides on hardened steel knife-edge races, minimizing friction for better stylus tracking.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — pivots literally rest on a sharp *knife-edge* ridge.

**Example:** “The vintage SME 3009’s knife-edge bearing gives it that legendary low-friction feel.”

**Cultural Note:** * Classic engineering solution in many high-end ’60s-’80s arms; still revered by vinyl hobbyists.
