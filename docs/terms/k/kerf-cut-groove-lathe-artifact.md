# Kerf-Cut Groove

**Definition:** **noun / technical slang.** A rare visual groove pattern resembling tiny wood-saw kerfs, sometimes left by a dull cutting stylus or damaged lacquer surface.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from woodworking term *kerf* — the thin cut made by a saw blade.

**Example:** “Under raking light you can spot a faint kerf-cut groove pattern, though it plays fine.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors note kerf-cut artifacts as curiosities of mid-century lacquer technology.
