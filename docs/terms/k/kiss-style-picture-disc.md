# KISS-Style Picture Disc

**Definition:** **noun / cultural.** A reference to the band KISS’s hugely popular late-’70s U.S. picture-disc LPs that sparked a mass trend of collectible rock picture discs.

**Etymology:** Named after the iconic band whose marketing set the template for flashy picture-vinyl merchandise.

**Example:** “That KISS-style picture disc was meant more for wall display than hi-fi listening.”

**Cultural Note:** * Became a merchandising phenomenon — every major rock act of the era tried a KISS-style picture disc release.
