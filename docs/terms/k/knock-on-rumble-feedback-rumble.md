# Knock-On Rumble

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Low-frequency vibration introduced when nearby doors slam, subs pound, or furniture resonates, “knocking-on” into a sensitive turntable setup.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — vibration *knocks-on* into the platter and stylus.

**Example:** “The subwoofer’s knocking-on rumble triggered woofer-pumping until we wall-mounted the table.”

**Cultural Note:** * A constant battle for club DJs spinning vinyl near booming subs or on shaky stages.
