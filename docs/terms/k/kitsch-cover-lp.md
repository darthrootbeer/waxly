# Kitsch

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Collector slang for records prized (or mocked) for their campy, over-the-top or unintentionally funny cover art — often thrift-store easy-listening and budget-label titles.

**Etymology:** From *kitsch* meaning gaudy or low-brow art + *cover* of an LP.

**Example:** “We throw a yearly party spinning only kitsch-cover LPs from thrift-store bins.”

**Cultural Note:** * A sub-hobby within crate-digging culture devoted purely to outrageous jacket art.
