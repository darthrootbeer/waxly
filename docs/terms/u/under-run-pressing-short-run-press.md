# Under-Run Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing slang.** A **pressing run that produced fewer copies than planned**, often due to plant shutdown, contract limit, or cancelled order.

**Etymology:** Plant term — production run falls *under* the planned *run*.

**Example:** “That soundtrack LP became rare because the label’s under-run pressing never got a repress.”

**Cultural Note:** * Explains many unexpectedly rare 1970s regional issues.
