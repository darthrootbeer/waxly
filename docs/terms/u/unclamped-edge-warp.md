# Unclamped Edge

**Definition:** **noun / warp type.** A **wavy outer-rim warp** caused by uneven cooling or storage pressure — usually flattenable with a weight or clamp.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *edge-warp* left *unclamped*.

**Example:** “The LP shows a minor unclamped edge-warp that disappears under a reflex clamp.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on 180 g modern pressings; collectors often keep a clamp handy.
