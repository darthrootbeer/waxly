# Un-Banded LP

**Definition:** **noun / mastering style.** A **record side without visible track-spacing ‘bands’**, appearing as one continuous groove spiral — common for classical, opera, live, or DJ-mix albums.

**Etymology:** Literal — LP *not banded* between tracks.

**Example:** “Collectors of vintage opera prefer the original un-banded LPs for uninterrupted visual flow.”

**Cultural Note:** * Typical for genres meant to be heard as continuous performances.
