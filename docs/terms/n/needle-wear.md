# Needle

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** Wear and flattening of the stylus tip from hours of use; eventually causes audible distortion and accelerates groove-wear.

**Etymology:** Straightforward — *wear* of the stylus *needle.*

**Example:** “Replace that cart — the needle-wear is obvious from the dulled high-end.”

**Cultural Note:** * Regular stylus inspection/replacement is critical to preserving vinyl longevity.
