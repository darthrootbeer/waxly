# Net-Weight

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing term.** The measured weight in grams of the raw vinyl “biscuit” pellet pressed into each record — determines final disc thickness (e.g., 140 g, 180 g, 200 g).

**Etymology:** Industrial term for *net weight* of raw material charge.

**Example:** “Plant QC rejected the run — net-weight was off, leading to thin, dish-warped LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** * Part of quality-control specs that audiophile labels advertise on hype-stickers.
