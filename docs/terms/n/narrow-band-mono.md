# Narrow

**Definition:** **noun / historical audio term.** Mono mixes with intentionally reduced frequency range (narrow-band) to suit AM radio or jukebox playback during the 1940s-60s.

**Etymology:** Refers to *narrow-bandwidth* frequency response of old equipment.

**Example:** “That early 45 is narrow-band mono — all midrange punch for car radios.”

**Cultural Note:** * A signature lo-fi sound of vintage pop singles and jukebox-era R&B.
