# Not-For-Sale Copy

**Definition:** **noun / promo term.** A promotional pressing distributed free to radio, reviewers, or in-store play — explicitly marked “Not For Sale.”

**Etymology:** Label copy text used for *promo-only* discs.

**Example:** “The white-label Not-For-Sale copy has the rare mono mix unavailable to the public LP.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectible for alternate mixes or provenance — radio-station library marks tell stories of airplay history.
