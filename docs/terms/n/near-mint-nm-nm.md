# Near-Mint

**Definition:** **noun / grading term.** A record grading just below Mint — virtually flawless with only superficial hairline scuffs that do not affect play; jacket likewise crisp with minimal shelf-wear.

**Etymology:** Grading shorthand — *near* perfect *mint* condition.

**Example:** “The first-press U.K. LP is Near-Mint — shiny vinyl, clean labels, sharp corners.”

**Cultural Note:** * The most common top collectible grade in Goldmine-style price guides.
