# New-Old-Stock

**Definition:** **noun / retail / collector term.** Unused, unopened vintage inventory discovered after decades in storage — applies to sealed records, cartridges, or accessories.

**Etymology:** Shorthand in retail: *new-old-stock* = new but old production.

**Cultural Note:** * NOS finds are legendary scores at estate sales or dusty warehouse clear-outs.
