# Neo-Psychedelic Wax

**Definition:** **noun / collector slang.** Modern pressings (1980s-present) of psychedelic-inspired rock, often issued on swirled or splatter-color vinyl as a nod to ’60s psych aesthetics.

**Etymology:** *Neo* = new + *psychedelic* + *wax* (slang for vinyl).

**Example:** “The neo-psychedelic wax edition comes on neon-splatter 180-gram LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** * A boutique-pressing niche beloved by garage-psych collectors and festival merch stands.
