# [Needle](../n/needle-wear.md)-Talk

**Definition:** **noun / historical slang.** The faint mechanical sound heard directly from the stylus vibrating in the groove, audible close to the turntable even with amp volume off.

**Etymology:** Old-school slang — the *needle* itself seems to *talk.*

**Example:** “On acoustic phonographs, needle-talk was loud enough to hear across the room.”

**Cultural Note:** * A charming relic of purely mechanical gramophones and even modern carts at very high volumes.
