# Non-Fill

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing defect.** A defect where molten vinyl fails to completely flow into the stamper during pressing, leaving small unfilled patches that cause ripping or tearing sounds during playback.

**Etymology:** Descriptive plant term — vinyl failed to *fill* stamper cavities.

**Example:** “Side-two crackles with zipper-like tearing — classic non-fill from rushed pressing.”

**Cultural Note:** * A notorious defect that plagued many high-volume plants during vinyl booms.
