# One-Sided LP

**Definition:** **noun / novelty / production choice.** A record with grooves on only one side — the flip side left smooth, blank, or sometimes laser-etched with artwork.

**Etymology:** Plain — an LP playable on only *one side.*

**Example:** “That hardcore band’s 12-inch one-sider has music on side A and an etched logo on side B.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common for EPs, singles, or art editions that don’t need both sides.
