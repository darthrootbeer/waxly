# Off-Center Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / pressing defect.** A defect where the record’s center hole isn’t perfectly aligned with the stamper’s groove spiral, causing the tonearm to sway slightly as it plays.

**Etymology:** Literal — the spindle hole is *off-center*.

**Example:** “The piano notes waver in pitch because side one is an off-center pressing.”

**Cultural Note:** * A common QC issue in some plants; often fixable by manually enlarging and re-centering the hole — at collector’s risk.
