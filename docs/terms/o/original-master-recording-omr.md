# Original Master Recording

**Definition:** **noun / audiophile marketing term.** A label designation — notably by Mobile Fidelity — indicating that the vinyl was mastered from the original master tape rather than a copy or safety dub.

**Etymology:** Self-descriptive marketing phrase: *original master recording*.

**Example:** “The OMR banner across the top strip is a hallmark of Mobile Fidelity’s early half-speed LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** * A key phrase in the audiophile reissue world that drives collector value and debates about analog vs digital sourcing.
