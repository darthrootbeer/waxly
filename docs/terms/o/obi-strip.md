# Obi Strip

**Definition:** **noun / packaging.** A narrow paper band wrapped vertically (sometimes horizontally) around Japanese LP jackets, printed with title, price, catalog info, or promotional blurbs. Considered part of the collectible packaging.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from Japanese word *obi* (kimono sash) describing its wrap-around style.

**Example:** “The Japanese pressing with its original obi strip intact is worth double the loose copy.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential to the value of Japanese pressings — many collectors hunt for intact obi strips.
