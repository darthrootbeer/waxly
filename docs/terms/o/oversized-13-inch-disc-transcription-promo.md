# Oversized 13-Inch Disc

**Definition:** **noun / historical / novelty.** A slightly larger-than-standard disc — typically 13 inches — sometimes used for special transcription discs or oversized promotional singles that required manual cueing.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — a disc measuring *over-sized* beyond the 12-inch norm.

**Example:** “The promo came on an oversized 13-inch disc with a silk-screened band logo.”

**Cultural Note:** * A quirky collector item, especially among vintage radio-station artifacts.
