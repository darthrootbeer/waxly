# Outer Jacket

**Definition:** **noun / packaging.** The main printed cover that holds both the inner sleeve and the record — sometimes protected by an additional clear poly outer sleeve.

**Etymology:** Plain — the *outer* protective *jacket*.

**Example:** “The original outer jacket has sharp corners and no ring-wear — great for resale value.”

**Cultural Note:** * The most visually iconic part of an LP — condition of the outer jacket heavily influences grading.
