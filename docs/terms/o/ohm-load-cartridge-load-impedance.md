# Ohm Load (Cartridge Load Impedance)

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The input impedance — expressed in ohms — that a phono stage presents to a cartridge; critical for matching MC cartridges (often 100Ω–500Ω) and affecting frequency response.

**Etymology:** Electronics term — *ohm* is unit of resistance.

**Example:** “Dial the MC preamp’s ohm load down to 100Ω for that low-output coil cart.”

**Cultural Note:** * A familiar tweak among audiophiles fine-tuning MC cartridge setups.
