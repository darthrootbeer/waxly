# Out-of-Print

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** A record title no longer manufactured or distributed by the label, often becoming scarce and rising in secondary-market value.

**Etymology:** Publishing term applied to records — no longer *in print*.

**Example:** “The LP went out-of-print in ’87 — originals fetch triple-digit prices now.”

**Cultural Note:** * OOP status fuels collector demand and drives crate-digging hunts for long-lost editions.
