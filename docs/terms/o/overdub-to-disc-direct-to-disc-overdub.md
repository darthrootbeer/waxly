# Overdub-to-Disc

**Definition:** **noun / recording method.** A studio technique where additional instruments or vocals were recorded live while cutting straight to disc, layering takes without tape — used occasionally in the 1940s-50s.

**Etymology:** *Over-dubbing* directly *to disc*.

**Example:** “Some hillbilly 78s were crude overdub-to-disc jobs — you can hear the balance shift mid-song.”

**Cultural Note:** * A transitional practice before multitrack tape made overdubbing easier and cleaner.
