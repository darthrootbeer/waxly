# One-Step Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / audiophile manufacturing.** A premium pressing method eliminating intermediate “mother” and “stamper” generations — stampers made directly from the lacquer or DMM copper master, reducing generational loss.

**Etymology:** Describes the single-*step* plating process.

**Example:** “The one-step pressing of that jazz classic has incredible microdetail compared to the old two-step reissue.”

**Cultural Note:** * Popularized by audiophile labels like Mobile Fidelity; marketed at collectors willing to pay high prices for minimal signal degradation.
