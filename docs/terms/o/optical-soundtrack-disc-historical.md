# Optical Soundtrack Disc

**Definition:** **noun / historical.** An experimental 1930s disc format that encoded film sound optically on a phonograph record, designed for synchronizing with motion pictures before magnetic film took over.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — audio track stored in *optical* form on a disc.

**Example:** “Some early talkies experimented with optical soundtrack discs spun in sync with the film reels.”

**Cultural Note:** * An interesting dead-end technology bridging silent film to synchronized sound.
