# Wash-Clean Method / Wet-Play

**Definition:** **noun / obsolete cleaning fad.** A **1960s-70s hi-fi practice of playing LPs wet with a water-based solution** to reduce clicks — later discouraged because of residue and groove damage.

**Etymology:** Advertising term — LP said to be *wash-clean* during play.

**Example:** “Some vintage LPs still carry inserts touting the controversial wash-clean wet-play method.”

**Cultural Note:** * Remembered as a failed hi-fi craze; now cited as a cautionary tale in preservation circles.
