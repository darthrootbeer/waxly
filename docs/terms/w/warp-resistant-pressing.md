# Warp-Resistant Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing claim.** A **pressing marketed as less prone to dish-warp or edge-warp**, often achieved through heavier vinyl weight, controlled cooling, or vacuum-hold techniques.

**Etymology:** Marketing phrase — vinyl designed to be *warp-resistant*.

**Example:** “The audiophile 180 g warp-resistant pressing stayed flat even after summer shipping.”

**Cultural Note:** * A key selling point during the 1970s ‘quality-vinyl’ arms race and revived in modern deluxe re-presses.
