# Wall-Mount Turntable Shelf

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory.** A **rigid shelf mounted directly to a load-bearing wall** to isolate a turntable from foot-fall vibration and bouncy floors.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *shelf* for turntable mounted on the *wall*.

**Example:** “Installing a wall-mount turntable shelf stopped the stylus skipping whenever someone walked across the room.”

**Cultural Note:** * A favorite tweak for suspended-floor homes and popular since Linn LP-12’s heyday in the late ’70s.
