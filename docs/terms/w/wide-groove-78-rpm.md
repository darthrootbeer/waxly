# Wide-Groove

**Definition:** A **heavy puck or clamp placed on the record spindle to improve contact with the platter**, helping tame warps and resonance.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — groove is *wide/macro* compared to modern micro-groove.

**Example:** “Play those wide-groove 78s with a proper 3-mil stylus to avoid chatter.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential knowledge for archivists and collectors of pre-LP recordings.
