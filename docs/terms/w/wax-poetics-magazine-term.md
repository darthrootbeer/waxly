# Wax Poetics

**Definition:** **noun / magazine title & slang.** A **renowned U.S. print magazine launched in 2001 covering crate-digging culture, hip-hop sampling, and vinyl history**; the name also shorthand for *serious talk about records*.

**Etymology:** Word-play — *wax* for records + *poetics* for storytelling/culture.

**Example:** “The Wax Poetics back issues on soul-jazz 45s are collector’s items themselves.”

**Cultural Note:** * Helped fuel the early-2000s vinyl revival and sampling scholarship.
