# Washboard Groove

**Definition:** **noun / defect slang.** A **groove that looks and feels wavy like a washboard** — usually from heat or stylus mistracking, leading to audible distortion.

**Etymology:** Visual analogy — groove ridges resemble a *washboard*.

**Example:** “The dance 12-inch developed washboard grooves after being spun with a worn DJ needle.”

**Cultural Note:** * An irreversible form of groove-wear — a warning about using bad styli.
