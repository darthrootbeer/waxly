# Warped Record

**Definition:** **noun / condition flaw.** A **record whose plane is bent or wavy** due to heat, storage pressure, or pressing defects — described as *[dish](../d/dish-warp/)-warp* (concave/convex) or *[edge](../e/edge-warp/)-warp* (rim-only).

**Etymology:** Descriptive — vinyl surface has *warped*.

**Example:** “The LP arrived with a mild edge-warp that still tracks fine with a clamp.”

**Cultural Note:** * A common risk in shipping during hot weather; collectors often flatten using clamps or professional flattener machines.
