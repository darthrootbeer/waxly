# Quadraphonic LP

**Definition:** **noun / format.** A 1970s-era vinyl format engineered to deliver **four-channel surround sound** when played through compatible decoders and amps. Several competing systems existed — SQ, QS, and CD-4 — each encoding rear channels differently.

**Etymology:** From *quadra-* (four) + *phonic* (sound).

**Example:** “The Pink Floyd quadraphonic LP reveals swirling guitars behind you with the proper SQ decoder.”

**Cultural Note:** * A short-lived ’70s hi-fi craze; prized by collectors of classic rock and jazz titles with unique quad mixes.
