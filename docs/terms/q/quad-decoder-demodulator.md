# Quad Decoder

**Definition:** **noun / hardware.** An external component or receiver circuit that **decodes** the encoded rear-channel information from quadraphonic LPs and routes it to four speaker outputs.

**Etymology:** Plain — device that *decodes* the quad signal.

**Example:** “His Sansui QRX-9001 has an internal quad decoder that handles both SQ and QS matrices.”

**Cultural Note:** * A hallmark of the brief ’70s surround-vinyl boom — now vintage-audio collector gear.
