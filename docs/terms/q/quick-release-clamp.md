# Quick-Release Clamp

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory.** A **center-spindle clamp or weight** with a cam-lock or push-button release for rapidly securing or removing the record during play.

**Etymology:** Self-descriptive — clamp designed for *quick release*.

**Example:** “The quick-release clamp flattens that edge warp and pops off instantly between sides.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on mid-to-high-end audiophile turntables; saves wear on delicate spindle bearings.
