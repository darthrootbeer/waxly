# Bootleg

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** An unauthorized vinyl pressing of live concerts, unreleased studio takes, or remixes — often cut from radio broadcasts or tapes without the artist’s consent.

**Etymology:** From 19th-century “bootleg” smuggling — hiding contraband in boot tops.

**Example:** “That Dylan bootleg on Trade Mark of Quality came in a plain white jacket with a rubber-stamped pig logo.”

**Cultural Note:** * Fueled rock-collector culture in the ’70s and rave remix culture in the ’90s; some bootlegs became historically significant.
