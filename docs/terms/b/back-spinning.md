# Back

**Definition:** **verb / noun.** Spinning the record backward quickly — either to rewind to a section or to create the signature “stutter” sound effect in scratching.

**Etymology:** Self-descriptive — literally spinning the record backward.

**Example:** “Grandmaster Flash made that back-spinning breakbeat loop famous in the park jams.”

**Cultural Note:** * Integral to hip-hop DJ technique; also used by radio DJs in the ’70s to censor live mistakes by rewinding a few seconds.
