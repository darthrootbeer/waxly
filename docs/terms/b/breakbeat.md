# Breakbeat

**Definition:** The percussive instrumental section of a funk, soul, or disco record, historically looped by DJs as the rhythmic backbone for hip-hop, jungle, and breakdance.

**Etymology:** Refers to the *break* in the song where the beat plays alone.

**Example:** “The ‘Amen Brother’ breakbeat pressed to countless 12-inches basically invented drum-and-bass.”

**Cultural Note:** * Foundation of multiple genres; breakbeat-hunting is still a crate-digger obsession.
