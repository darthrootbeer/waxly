# Beat

**Definition:** **verb / noun.** The DJ technique of synchronizing the tempo and downbeat of two records so they blend seamlessly during a mix.

**Etymology:** Club-DJ jargon from the disco era — literally “matching the beats.”

**Example:** “She beat-matched the house classic at 124 BPM over the acapella without touching the pitch slider.”

**Cultural Note:** * Invented by early disco DJs like Francis Grasso in the late ’60s/early ’70s — the skill that birthed modern club DJing.
