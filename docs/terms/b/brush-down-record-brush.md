# Brush-Down

**Definition:** **noun / verb.** A quick cleaning pass using a carbon-fiber or velvet brush to remove surface dust before play.

**Etymology:** Literal — brushing down the record.

**Example:** “Give that LP a brush-down; static’s making the stylus crackle.”

**Cultural Note:** * A ritualistic move for many collectors — the little flick before the needle drops.
