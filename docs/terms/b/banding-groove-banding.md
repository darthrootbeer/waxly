# Banding

**Definition:** Visible spacing or “bands” in the grooves of an LP that indicate separate tracks; silent grooves cut between songs.

**Etymology:** Refers to the *bands* of smooth, unmodulated groove between recorded sections.

**Example:** “You can spot the drum solo on that prog LP by the narrow band halfway through side two.”

**Cultural Note:** * Some concept albums were cut without banding to create a continuous play-through.
