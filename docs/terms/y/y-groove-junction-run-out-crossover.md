# Y-Groove Junction

**Definition:** **noun / cutting-room slang.** A **rare groove-geometry quirk where two run-out spirals merge like a ‘Y’-shaped junction** — usually from a cutting-lathe mis-feed or playful locked-groove trick.

**Etymology:** Visual description — run-out groove forms a *Y-groove junction*.

**Example:** “That avant-garde LP hides a Y-groove junction in the dead-wax that randomly drops the stylus into one of two locked loops.”

**Cultural Note:** * A collector curiosity found on a few experimental or mis-cut discs.
