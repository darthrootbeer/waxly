# Yard-Sale Find

**Definition:** **noun / collector slang.** A **record discovered at a yard sale, garage sale, or flea-market table**, often for a fraction of its collector value — the casual cousin of crate-digging.

**Etymology:** Colloquial — a *find* at a *yard-sale*.

**Example:** “Scored a Yard-Sale Find — a first-press *Kind of Blue* for two bucks in a milk crate on someone’s driveway.”

**Cultural Note:** * A rite of passage story among vinyl hunters; many holy-grails resurface this way.
