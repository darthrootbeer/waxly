# Yellow

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** A **promotional pressing distinguished by a yellow center-label** used by certain labels in the 1960s–70s to mark DJ/radio copies.

**Etymology:** Literal — promo run pressed with *yellow-label*.

**Example:** “The Motown yellow-label promo often contains the dedicated mono 45 mix prized by northern-soul DJs.”

**Cultural Note:** * A niche but recognizable label-variant for collectors of 7-inch singles.
