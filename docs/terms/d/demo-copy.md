# Demo Copy

**Definition:** A promotional pressing distributed to radio stations, reviewers, or shops before official release—often stamped or stickered “For Demonstration Only.”

**Etymology:** Short for “demonstration copy.”

**Example:** “The white-label demo copy has hotter mastering than the commercial issue.”

**Cultural Note:** * Promo demos with unique mixes or edits are collector gold, especially for Northern soul and disco 45s.
