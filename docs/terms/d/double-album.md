# Double

**Definition:** A release spanning two full LP discs—typically 4 sides—either for length or artistic concept.

**Etymology:** Literal—an *album* with *double* the discs.

**Example:** “That double-album prog opus uses the side flips like chapter breaks.”

**Cultural Note:** * An LP-era milestone signifying ambition: live sets, concept epics, deluxe retrospectives.
