# Dead Wax

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** The smooth vinyl between the end of the last track and the label, often bearing etched catalog numbers, initials, or cryptic messages.

**Etymology:** Old cutting-room slang: the “wax” section with no music is *dead.*

**Example:** “Check the dead-wax etching—‘RL’ means Bob Ludwig mastered this cut.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors obsess over dead-wax inscriptions to ID mastering engineers, plants, or hidden jokes.
