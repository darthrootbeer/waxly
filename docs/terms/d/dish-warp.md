# Dish

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A type of warp where the record’s edge is flat but the center rises or dips like a shallow dish.

**Etymology:** Named for its dish-shaped profile.

**Example:** “The stylus still tracks fine—the dish-warp is mild enough not to cause skips.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common from heat-warped storage; sometimes fixable via careful de-warping.
