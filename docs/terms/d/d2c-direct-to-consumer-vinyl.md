# D2C (Direct

**Definition:** **noun / abbreviation.** A distribution model where artists or labels sell vinyl directly to fans—often online—skipping traditional retail.

**Etymology:** Modern e-commerce term: *Direct to Consumer.*

**Example:** “That indie synthwave LP was only offered as a D2C drop on the band’s Bandcamp page.”

**Cultural Note:** * Gained momentum in the 2010s vinyl boom—especially for crowdfunded pressings and limited splatter variants.
