# Dubplate

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A one-off acetate or lacquer disc cut directly from a master tape or file—used by sound-system DJs to test exclusive mixes before mass pressing.

**Etymology:** Jamaican sound-system slang: a “plate” cut for *dub* versions.

**Example:** “He pulled a fresh dubplate straight from Kingston—no one else had that riddim yet.”

**Cultural Note:** * Backbone of reggae, dancehall, jungle, and drum-and-bass sound-clash culture—symbol of DJ exclusivity.
