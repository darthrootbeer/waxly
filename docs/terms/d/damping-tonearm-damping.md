# Damping (Tonearm Damping)

**Definition:** The use of silicone fluid or magnetic resistance to control tonearm movement and suppress unwanted resonance or skip.

**Etymology:** From physics: *to damp* means to reduce oscillation.

**Example:** “Adding a bit of tonearm damping tamed the foot-fall feedback on my suspended table.”

**Cultural Note:** * High-end arms often feature adjustable damping troughs for cartridge fine-tuning.
