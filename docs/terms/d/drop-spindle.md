# Drop-Spindle

**Definition:** A tall spindle designed to hold stacked records in a changer so each disc drops after the previous finishes.

**Etymology:** Descriptive—the record *drops* down the spindle.

**Example:** “We found the missing drop-spindle for Grandpa’s Garrard changer in a drawer of spare parts.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on mid-century console stereos; vanished with the move to single-play audiophile decks.
