# Acoustic Suspension

**Definition:** A sealed-box speaker-cabinet design popular from the late ’50s onward, known for tight, deep bass response — a favorite among hi-fi vinyl listeners seeking accurate low-end without port “boom.”

**Etymology:** Refers to the trapped air inside the sealed cabinet acting as an acoustic spring that controls woofer movement.

**Example:** “Pair that vintage AR-3a with a clean 60-watt tube amp and you’ll hear why acoustic suspension ruled the ’60s hi-fi scene.”

**Cultural Note:** * Acoustic-suspension speakers were marketed as the perfect match for vinyl’s warmth during the golden age of living-room hi-fi consoles.
