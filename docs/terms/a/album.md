# Album

**Definition:** A collection of musical tracks issued as a cohesive package on a single or multi-disc vinyl release. On LPs (33⅓ rpm, 12-inch), an album typically runs 30–50 minutes per disc.

**Etymology:** Originally referred to bound “albums” of 78 rpm sleeves before the LP format allowed multiple songs on one disc.

**Example:** “His debut album still sounds best on the original 1978 U.K. pressing — the remaster is too bright.”

**Cultural Note:** * The term survived the jump from physical binders to LPs and later to CDs and streaming playlists.
