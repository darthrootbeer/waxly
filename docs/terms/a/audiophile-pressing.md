# Audiophile Pressing

**Definition:** A premium vinyl release manufactured with meticulous mastering, heavier virgin-vinyl stock (often 180 g or 200 g), and quality-controlled plating for superior sound.

**Etymology:** Combines *audio* + *philos* (Greek “loving”) — literally, “lover of high-fidelity sound.”

**Example:** “That 200-gram audiophile pressing from Mobile Fidelity wipes the floor with the budget reissue.”

**Cultural Note:** * These pressings fueled the late-’70s and ’80s resurgence of hi-fi vinyl for serious listeners willing to pay extra for sonic nirvana.
