# A/B Test Press

**Definition:** A preliminary batch of records pressed by a plant in two slightly different ways — for example, using different lacquers, vinyl compounds, or groove depths — to compare sound quality before committing to a full run.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from the term “A/B testing” in audio engineering and product design, meaning to compare two variants side-by-side.

**Example:** “The label did an A/B test press to decide whether the translucent blue or the standard black had better low-end response.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors often hunt down these pressings because only a handful were ever made — sometimes as few as 5–10 copies — making them grail-level items.
