# Add-On Arm Weight

**Definition:** A small auxiliary weight attached to the rear of a tonearm or to a detachable headshell to balance heavier cartridges or DJ styli.

**Etymology:** Plainly descriptive of its function — adding weight to the arm.

**Example:** “After swapping to that chunky Shure M44-7 cart, I had to screw on an add-on arm weight to keep the tracking force correct.”

**Cultural Note:** * Battle DJs often keep a couple of nickel-sized arm weights taped under the turntable lid.
