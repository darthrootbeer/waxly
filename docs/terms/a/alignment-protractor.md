# Alignment Protractor

**Definition:** A printed or mirrored template used to align a turntable cartridge so the stylus tracks grooves at the proper angle across the record’s radius, minimizing distortion.

**Etymology:** Named after the geometry tool — it projects alignment lines over the tonearm arc.

**Example:** “Grab an alignment protractor before you blame the inner-groove distortion on your pressing.”

**Cultural Note:** * Hi-fi hobbyists often debate Baerwald vs Stevenson vs Löfgren alignment geometries on forums late into the night.
