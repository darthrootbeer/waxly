# Anti

**Definition:** A spring- or magnet-based control on turntables that counteracts the inward pull on the tonearm caused by groove friction, helping the stylus stay centered in the groove.

**Etymology:** Describes its job: reducing the “skating” force that drags the needle toward the label.

**Example:** “Dial in a touch more anti-skate or the right channel will distort before the left.”

**Cultural Note:** * Scratch DJs sometimes defeat anti-skate entirely to keep the stylus locked under back-cue pressure.
