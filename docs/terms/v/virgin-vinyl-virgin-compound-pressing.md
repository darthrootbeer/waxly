# Virgin Vinyl

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing grade.** A **record pressed from 100% new PVC compound with no recycled re-grind material**, resulting in cleaner surfaces and lower noise.

**Etymology:** Industry term — *virgin* = unused raw vinyl resin.

**Example:** “Audiophile labels boast about virgin-vinyl pressings for the quietest backgrounds.”

**Cultural Note:** * A selling-point on many 1970s-80s quality pressings and modern reissues.
