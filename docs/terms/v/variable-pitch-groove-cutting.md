# Variable-Pitch Groove Cutting

**Definition:** **noun / mastering technique.** A **lathe system that automatically adjusts the spacing (‘pitch’) of grooves depending on the upcoming signal’s loudness** — conserves disc space while avoiding [groove](../g/groove-wear/) collisions.

**Etymology:** Cutting-room jargon — groove *pitch* made *variable* by preview signal.

**Example:** “By the late ’60s most mastering rooms adopted variable-pitch groove cutting to maximize side length.”

**Cultural Note:** * Made long classical sides and concept-albums possible on LP without major volume loss.
