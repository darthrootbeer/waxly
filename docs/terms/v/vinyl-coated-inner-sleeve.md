# Vinyl Coated Inner Sleeve

**Definition:** **noun / packaging hazard.** A **paper inner sleeve lined with a thin vinyl-like plastic film** once used for premium LPs; prone to chemical reactions that can fog or imprint records over decades.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — inner sleeve *coated* with *vinyl* film.

**Example:** “Replace the vintage vinyl-coated inner sleeves before they imprint milky patterns on the grooves.”

**Cultural Note:** * A cautionary tale in archival storage — many 1970s audiophile labels used them.
