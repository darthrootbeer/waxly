# Vacuum Platter

**Definition:** **noun / turntable design.** A **turntable platter that uses gentle suction to flatten records against its surface** for improved coupling and reduced warps.

**Etymology:** Engineering term — platter uses *vacuum* to *hold down* the disc.

**Cultural Note:** * A high-end feature on late-70s/80s audiophile decks and some modern studio lathes.
