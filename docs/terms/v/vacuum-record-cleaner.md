# Vacuum Record Cleaner

**Definition:** **noun / cleaning device.** A **machine that applies a cleaning fluid to the record’s surface, scrubs the grooves, and then vacuums away the dirty fluid** — the classic audiophile method before ultrasonic units.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — cleaner that uses *vacuum* suction.

**Example:** “A vacuum record cleaner restored that dusty thrift-store LP to near-silent play.”

**Cultural Note:** * Standard equipment for serious collectors since the 1970s; VPI and Nitty Gritty are iconic brands.
