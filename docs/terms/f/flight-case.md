# Flight Case

**Definition:** A rugged, foam-lined metal-edged case used by touring DJs and live-sound crews to transport vinyl safely.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from airline-freight “flight case” designs.

**Example:** “The house DJ rolled in with two 70-LP flight cases ready for the night’s set.”

**Cultural Note:** * A badge of professionalism for ’80s-’00s club and rave DJs.
