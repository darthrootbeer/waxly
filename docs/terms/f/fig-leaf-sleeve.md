# Fig-Leaf Sleeve

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A censored variant picture-sleeve that hides nudity or controversial artwork — prized by collectors for its rarity.

**Etymology:** Reference to the classical fig-leaf covering nudity in sculpture.

**Cultural Note:** * Labels often rushed out fig-leaf sleeves after public backlash, creating instant collectible variants.
