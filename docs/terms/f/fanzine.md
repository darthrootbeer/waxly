# Fanzine

**Definition:** A self-published, photocopied magazine created by fans to chronicle local record scenes, punk gigs, or indie-label news — often trading ads for mail-order vinyl.

**Etymology:** Blend of *fan* + *magazine.*

**Example:** “That ’82 hardcore fanzine listed all the mail-order 7-inch singles from tiny Midwest labels.”

**Cultural Note:** * Fanzines were the lifeblood of punk-DIY vinyl culture pre-internet — many 45 RPM cult classics were first advertised there.
