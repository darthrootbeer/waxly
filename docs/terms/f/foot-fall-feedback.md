# Foot-Fall Feedback

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Low-frequency rumble or skipping triggered when footsteps or stage vibration reach the turntable, especially on suspended-floor setups.

**Etymology:** From *foot-fall* impact feeding back acoustically into the stylus.

**Example:** “Wall-mount the deck to kill that foot-fall feedback when people dance near the hi-fi rack.”

**Cultural Note:** * A classic club-DJ nightmare before isolation platforms and better tonearm damping became widespread.
