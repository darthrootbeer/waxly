# Finger Lift

**Definition:** A small curved tab attached to a headshell that lets you grip and guide the tonearm without touching the cartridge body.

**Etymology:** Literal — a *lift* for your *finger.*

**Example:** “Replace the bent finger-lift on that Technics headshell before it snaps off completely.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential for DJs cueing in dark booths; some audiophile arms omit it for sleek looks.
