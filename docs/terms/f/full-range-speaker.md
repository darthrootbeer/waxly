# Full-Range Speaker

**Definition:** A speaker driver designed to reproduce as much of the audible frequency spectrum as possible from a single cone — common in vintage mono console stereos.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — *full range* of frequencies from one unit.

**Example:** “That ’50s console runs a 12-inch full-range speaker driven by a warm EL84 tube amp.”

**Cultural Note:** * Favored by some vinyl purists for their coherent point-source imaging.
