# Frequency Response

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The measurable range of audio frequencies a system can reproduce — critical spec for cartridges, speakers, and mastering of vinyl.

**Etymology:** Plain engineering term: *response* across the frequency spectrum.

**Example:** “That vintage Shure V15 cartridge still boasts a flat 20 Hz–20 kHz frequency response.”

**Cultural Note:** * A key bragging point in ’70s hi-fi ads competing for vinyl-lover dollars.
