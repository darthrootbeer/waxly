# Fish-Eye Label

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A cosmetic pressing flaw where bubbles or dimples form under the label paper, creating a “fish-eye” appearance.

**Etymology:** Named for the round bubble shape resembling a fish’s eye.

**Example:** “That Motown 45 has a slight fish-eye label but plays mint.”

**Cultural Note:** * Collectors may downgrade grading for severe fish-eye defects on otherwise clean copies.
