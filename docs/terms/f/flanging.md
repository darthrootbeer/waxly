# Flanging (Tape

**Definition:** **noun / verb.** An audio effect created by mixing a signal with a slightly delayed copy, producing a swooshing comb-filter sound — originally achieved by dragging a finger on a second tape reel’s flange; often heard on psychedelic vinyl classics.

**Etymology:** From “flange,” the rim of the tape reel that was pressed to slow it.

**Example:** “The original mono 45 has real tape flanging on the drum break — not a digital plug-in.”

**Cultural Note:** * A studio-born ’60s effect immortalized on vinyl by The Beatles and Hendrix.
