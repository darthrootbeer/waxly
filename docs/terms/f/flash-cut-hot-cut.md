# Flash-Cut

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A lacquer master cut at higher volume and deeper groove for maximum club-play punch — often hotter but more prone to pre-echo or skipping on weak tonearms.

**Etymology:** Studio slang for a fast, “flashy” hot-level cut.

**Example:** “That NYC disco 12-inch flash-cut nearly pegs the VU meters — sounds huge but watch your stylus.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential in late-’70s disco 12-inch wars for dance-floor loudness.
