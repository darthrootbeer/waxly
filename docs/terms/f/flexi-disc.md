# Flexi

**Definition:** A thin, flexible PVC sheet record often bound in magazines or mailed as promotional giveaways — playable on standard turntables despite its flimsy feel.

**Etymology:** From *flexible disc.*

**Example:** “The fanzine’s first issue came with a free punk single on a square red flexi-disc stapled to the cover.”

**Cultural Note:** * A DIY and promotional staple from the ’60s through the ’80s; collectible for novelty value.
