# Fringe

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A tiny independent record label operating on the fringes of the mainstream — often with ultra-small vinyl runs and cult followings.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — a label on the *fringe* of the industry.

**Example:** “That doom-metal LP came out on a fringe-label that pressed only 300 copies.”

**Cultural Note:** * Crate-diggers love fringe-labels for unearthed regional funk, garage-rock, and DIY punk gems.
