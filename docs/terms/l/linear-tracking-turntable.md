# Linear-Tracking Turntable

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A turntable whose tonearm moves straight across the record’s radius on a rail, maintaining a near-perfect tangential angle to the groove, reducing tracking-angle distortion.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — tonearm tracks *linearly* instead of pivoting.

**Example:** “The Technics SL-10 linear-tracking turntable plays records vertically or horizontally.”

**Cultural Note:** * A futuristic ’70s-’80s hi-fi innovation that dazzled magazine ads and collectors of industrial design.
