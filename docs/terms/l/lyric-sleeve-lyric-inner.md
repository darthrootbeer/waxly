# Lyric Sleeve

**Definition:** An inner sleeve printed with full song lyrics and sometimes photos or credits — a mainstay of the album-art boom of the ’70s-’80s.

**Etymology:** Plain — inner *sleeve* bearing *lyrics.*

**Example:** “The original lyric sleeve is missing — that knocks a few bucks off collector value.”

**Cultural Note:** * Many iconic album aesthetics rely on the lyric sleeve as part of the full artwork package.
