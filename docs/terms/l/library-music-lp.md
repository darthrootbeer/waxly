# Library Music LP

**Definition:** **noun / cultural.** A record produced for film, TV, and radio production libraries — often generic instrumental cues, sold only to broadcasters but beloved by crate-diggers for funky breaks.

**Etymology:** From production-*library* recordings issued on *LPs.*

**Example:** “That Italian library-music LP hides killer jazz-funk drum breaks sampled by ’90s hip-hop producers.”

**Cultural Note:** * Highly collectible for rare grooves, especially European ’60s-’70s labels like CAM, De Wolfe, and KPM.
