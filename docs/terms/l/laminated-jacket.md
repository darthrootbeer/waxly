# Laminated Jacket

**Definition:** A jacket whose printed paper slick is coated in a thin glossy film or varnish, typical of mid-century European LPs.

**Etymology:** From *laminated* paper layers sealed with gloss.

**Example:** “Those laminated flip-back Beatles sleeves stayed glossy but often developed seam-splits.”

**Cultural Note:** * A quick visual hallmark of U.K./Euro 1950s-60s original pressings.
