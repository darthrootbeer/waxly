# Locked Groove

**Definition:** **noun / technical / creative.** A circular groove at the end of a side where the stylus loops indefinitely instead of spiraling to the label — can be silent, contain a loop of sound, or be used for hidden tracks.

**Etymology:** Literal — a *groove* that stays *locked* in a loop.

**Example:** “The Beatles’ *Sgt. Pepper* U.K. first-press famously hides a gibberish loop in the locked groove.”

**Cultural Note:** * Became a playground for avant-garde, electronic, and punk artists seeking vinyl-only Easter eggs.
