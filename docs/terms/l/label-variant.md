# Label Variant

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** Any pressing distinguished by a change in label design — color, font, logo placement, rim text — often signifying a specific plant or production period.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — a *variant* of the paper *label.*

**Example:** “The first U.S. label variant has deep-groove blue text before they switched to silver.”

**Cultural Note:** * Label-variant hunting is a core discipline of serious collectors and price-guide catalogers.
