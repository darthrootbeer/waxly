# Lead-In Groove

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The smooth spiral groove at the outer rim of a record that guides the stylus toward the first modulated track groove.

**Etymology:** Literal — the groove that *leads-in* to the music.

**Example:** “The DJ complained the lead-in groove was too short for a safe back-cue.”

**Cultural Note:** * Length varies by pressing; critical for cue-burn-prone club 12-inches.
