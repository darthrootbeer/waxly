# Loudness War Cut

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A modern reissue or club 12-inch mastered at the highest possible groove amplitude to compete in perceived loudness, sometimes at the expense of dynamic range or tracking.

**Etymology:** From the CD-era “*loudness war*” trend carried back into vinyl cutting.

**Example:** “That remastered loudness-war cut looks like a canyon — no wonder it distorts near the inner grooves.”

**Cultural Note:** * A contentious audiophile topic as vinyl purists decry hyper-compressed modern masters.
