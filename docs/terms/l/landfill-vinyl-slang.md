# Landfill Vinyl

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Collector’s derogatory term for cheaply produced, mass-market LPs or reissues considered disposable or of little musical/artistic value.

**Etymology:** Implying the record is destined for the *landfill.*

**Example:** “That bargain-bin synth-pop comp is pure landfill vinyl — pressed thin and mastered from a CD.”

**Cultural Note:** * Term popularized during the 2010s vinyl boom backlash against low-quality cash-grab reissues.
