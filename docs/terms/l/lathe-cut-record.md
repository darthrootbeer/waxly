# Lathe

**Definition:** **noun / DIY / boutique.** A one-off or small-batch record individually cut on a record-lathe rather than pressed from stampers — common for micro-labels, art pieces, or instant souvenirs.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — record is *cut on a lathe.*

**Example:** “The folk singer sold lathe-cut clear acrylic singles at the merch table — each one hand-signed.”

**Cultural Note:** * Revived in the 2000s as a craft medium for indie artists and collectors craving true limited editions.
