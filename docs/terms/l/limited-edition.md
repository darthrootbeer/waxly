# Limited Edition

**Definition:** A release intentionally capped at a fixed number of copies, often numbered or with unique packaging, making it scarcer than standard issues.

**Etymology:** Plain — an *edition* produced in *limited* quantity.

**Example:** “Picked up the limited-edition splatter-vinyl run — only 500 pressed worldwide.”

**Cultural Note:** * Fuel for Record-Store-Day hype and boutique-label marketing.
