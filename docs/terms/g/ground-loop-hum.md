# Ground

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** A low 50/60 Hz hum caused by multiple components sharing an electrical ground at different potentials — common in turntable-to-amp setups if the ground wire is loose or missing.

**Etymology:** From the looped ground path that induces hum current.

**Example:** “Tighten the turntable ground screw — that ground-loop hum is drowning the intro.”

**Cultural Note:** * A rite-of-passage troubleshooting moment for every new vinyl hobbyist.
