# Groove

**Definition:** Cumulative erosion of groove walls from years of playback — especially with worn styli or excessive tracking force.

**Etymology:** Plain description: grooves become *worn.*

**Example:** “The LP looks clean but you can hear groove-wear in the crunchy cymbals.”

**Cultural Note:** * A key grading factor for used vinyl — many ’50s-’70s jukebox 45s suffer heavy groove-wear.
