# Groove

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** When the stylus physically hops out of one spiral groove into the next (or back) — often due to a warp, foot-fall vibration, or too-light tracking.

**Etymology:** Literal — the needle *jumps* grooves.

**Example:** “Add a gram of tracking weight — that warped 12-inch keeps groove-jumping during the bass drop.”

**Cultural Note:** * The bane of both DJs in the booth and hi-fi listeners with springy wooden floors.
