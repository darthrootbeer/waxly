# Groovebox

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** While technically an electronic sampler-sequencer, in vinyl-DJ slang it refers to portable drum-machine samplers (e.g., Roland MC-303) often used alongside turntables to add beats to records.

**Etymology:** Marketing name that entered club-DJ vernacular in the late ’90s.

**Example:** “Their live set was just two decks, a mixer, and a groovebox looping 808 kicks.”

**Cultural Note:** * Bridges the vinyl-to-digital transition era of late ’90s dance music performance.
