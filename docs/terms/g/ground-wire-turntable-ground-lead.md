# [Ground](../g/ground-loop-hum/)-Wire

**Definition:** A dedicated wire that bonds the turntable chassis to the amplifier’s ground to prevent hum and static.

**Etymology:** Literal — the *wire* for electrical *grounding.*

**Example:** “Don’t forget to hook the Technics ground-wire to the receiver’s GND post.”

**Cultural Note:** * Almost every vintage deck came with a dangling ground-wire; many modern USB tables omit it.
