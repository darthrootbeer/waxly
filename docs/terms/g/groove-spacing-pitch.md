# Groove Spacing

**Definition:** **noun / technical.** The distance between adjacent grooves on a record, determined by cutting-lathe pitch control; wider spacing allows louder cuts but shortens play-time.

**Etymology:** Literal — spacing of the *grooves.*

**Example:** “The 12-inch single’s wider groove spacing is why it slams louder than the LP mix.”

**Cultural Note:** * A crucial factor in the disco-era hot-cut ‘loudness wars.’
