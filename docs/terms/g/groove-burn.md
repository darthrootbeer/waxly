# Groove Burn

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** Visible greyish streaking and audible distortion in vinyl caused by excessive tracking force or repeated heavy cue-burn at a single spot.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — grooves appear visually *burned.*

**Example:** “Club DJs hammered that intro so hard the record’s got permanent groove burn.”

**Cultural Note:** * A classic giveaway of over-played disco 12-inches pulled from bargain bins.
