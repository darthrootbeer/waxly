# Closed-Groove Loop

**Definition:** A special groove cut to circle back on itself, trapping the stylus to loop sound indefinitely — sometimes placed mid-side as an experimental effect.

**Etymology:** Literal description: groove is closed in a loop.

**Example:** “The noise-rock LP hides a screaming closed-groove loop halfway through side A — freaked me out the first time.”

**Cultural Note:** * Beloved by avant-garde and techno producers for Easter-egg loops and endless beat beds.
