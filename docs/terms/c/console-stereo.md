# Console Stereo

**Definition:** A mid-century piece of furniture integrating a turntable, tube amp, radio, and speakers into a long wooden cabinet — once a living-room centerpiece.

**Etymology:** Named for its all-in-one *console* design.

**Example:** “We pulled a mint 1962 Magnavox console stereo from an estate sale — tubes still hum like warm honey.”

**Cultural Note:** * A nostalgia icon of ’50s–’70s suburban living rooms; now restored by retro-audio hobbyists.
