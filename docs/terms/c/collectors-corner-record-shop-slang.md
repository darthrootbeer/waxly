# Collectors' Corner

**Definition:** **noun / slang.** A section of a shop reserved for high-priced or rare vinyl — often behind the counter or in a glass case.

**Etymology:** Generic retail slang highlighting exclusivity for *collectors.*

**Example:** “Ask to see the collectors’ corner — that’s where they hide the Japanese jazz pressings.”

**Cultural Note:** * A classic rite of crate-digging: befriending shop staff to get access to the collectors’ corner stock.
