# Cartridge

**Definition:** The removable electro-mechanical pickup at the end of a tonearm that holds the stylus and converts groove vibrations into electrical signals.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from “cartridge” as a self-contained component module.

**Example:** “Upgrading the cartridge to an Ortofon 2M Blue opened up the highs and detail on my jazz LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** * A ritual upgrade path for audiophiles; DJ cartridges often feature reinforced cantilevers for rough handling.
