# Cat-No.

**Definition:** **noun / abbreviation.** A unique alphanumeric code assigned by a label to identify a specific release or pressing — often printed on spine, label, and run-out.

**Etymology:** Short for “catalogue number.”

**Example:** “Compare the cat-no. on the spine: the first U.S. press is SD-19129, later reissue is 19129-2.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential to Discogs research and collector hunts for country- or year-specific editions.
