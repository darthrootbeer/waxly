# Color-Vinyl Pressing

**Definition:** Vinyl records pressed in colored PVC instead of standard black carbon-loaded compound — can be opaque, [translucent](../t/translucent-vinyl-variant/), or even marbled.

**Etymology:** Literal — vinyl of a different color.

**Example:** “The first 500 copies came as a marbled red-and-gold color-vinyl pressing with hand-stamped jackets.”

**Cultural Note:** * A marketing staple for limited editions, Record Store Day drops, and metal-scene splatter variants.
