# Changer (Record Changer

**Definition:** A turntable mechanism — popular mid-century — that automatically drops the next record from a stacked spindle after each side finishes.

**Etymology:** Named for its ability to *change* records automatically.

**Example:** “Grandma’s console stereo still has a five-disc changer — perfect for old box-set symphonies.”

**Cultural Note:** * Fell out of audiophile favor due to record wear; now prized by nostalgia collectors restoring mid-century consoles.
