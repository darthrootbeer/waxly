# Cleaning Solution

**Definition:** Specialized liquid, often alcohol-free with surfactants, used to dissolve dust, oils, and mold release from vinyl grooves.

**Etymology:** Literal — a solution for cleaning.

**Example:** “Don’t use straight rubbing alcohol; get a proper record-cleaning solution to protect the PVC.”

**Cultural Note:** * Key to archival preservation — many collectors swear by DIY recipes vs. pricey commercial brands.
