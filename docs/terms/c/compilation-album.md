# Compilation Album

**Definition:** An LP or multi-disc set collecting songs from various artists or sessions — often themed by hits, genre, or label samplers.

**Etymology:** From *compile*, meaning to gather together.

**Example:** “That ’78 Stiff Records compilation LP broke half the U.K. punk bands to American ears.”

**Cultural Note:** * Budget-bin gateway for discovering new artists; also a major driver of reggae and Northern-soul scene popularity.
