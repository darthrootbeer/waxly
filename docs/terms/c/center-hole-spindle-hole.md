# Center Hole

**Definition:** The precisely-cut hole in the middle of every disc that seats on the turntable spindle; slight off-center drilling causes audible wow.

**Etymology:** Literal.

**Example:** “That pressing’s got an off-center hole — you can see the tonearm sway like a pendulum.”

**Cultural Note:** * Quality control of center-hole drilling separates budget pressings from premium ones.
