# Cabinet Rumble

**Definition:** Low-frequency resonance transmitted from a speaker cabinet or furniture into the turntable, causing audible woofer flutter or muddy bass.

**Etymology:** Plain description: rumble caused by the cabinet.

**Example:** “Shift the turntable off that Ikea shelf — the sub’s causing cabinet rumble in the needle.”

**Cultural Note:** * The reason hi-fi enthusiasts use isolation platforms, wall-mount shelves, or massive plinths.
