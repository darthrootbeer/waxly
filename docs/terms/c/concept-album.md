# Concept Album

**Definition:** A cohesive LP built around a unifying narrative or theme, intended to be experienced as a whole rather than as individual singles.

**Etymology:** Named for its guiding *concept.*

**Example:** “On vinyl, a concept album’s side breaks often mirror the storyline’s acts.”

**Cultural Note:** * Thrived in the LP era — think prog-rock epics, story-driven hip-hop records, and Broadway-inspired pop operas.
