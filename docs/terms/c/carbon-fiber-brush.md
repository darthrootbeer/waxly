# Carbon

**Definition:** A staple record-cleaning tool whose ultra-fine conductive bristles sweep off dust while discharging static electricity from vinyl surfaces.

**Etymology:** Descriptive of the brush’s bristle material.

**Example:** “Run the carbon-fiber brush in slow circles — it’ll lift the lint and zap the static crackle.”

**Cultural Note:** * Became popular in the late ’70s alongside anti-static inner sleeves.
