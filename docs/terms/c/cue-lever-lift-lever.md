# Cue Lever

**Definition:** A small damped lever on the tonearm base that gently raises or lowers the stylus onto the record to prevent accidental drops.

**Etymology:** Literal — lever for cueing.

**Example:** “Replace the dried cue-lever damping oil or the needle will slam onto the vinyl.”

**Cultural Note:** * Standard on hi-fi decks but sometimes removed on stripped-down battle turntables to avoid interference.
