# Regional Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / collector tag.** A pressing **manufactured in a specific geographic region** — often on small local labels or contracted plants — sometimes with unique stampers, labels, or mixes.

**Etymology:** Straightforward — pressing tied to a *region*.

**Example:** “That Midwest garage-rock single exists only as a 1967 regional pressing on a tiny label.”

**Cultural Note:** * A hot sub-field for crate-diggers hunting obscure soul, funk, garage, gospel, and punk records.
