# Reverb

**Definition:** **noun / [reggae](../r/reggae.md) / [dub](../d/dub.md)-plate slang.** A **version mix sent hot through a spring-reverb tank** during cutting — a signature sonic texture of Jamaican dub culture.

**Etymology:** Studio slang — dub *cut* through *reverb tank*.

**Example:** “That ’70s King Tubby reverb-tank dub cut drenches the snare hits in cavernous spring splash.”

**Cultural Note:** * A hallmark of sound-system dub singles — every pressing sounds slightly unique to the engineer’s live mix.
