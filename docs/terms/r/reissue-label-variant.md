# Reissue Label Variant

**Definition:** **noun / collector term.** A **later label design** (fonts, logos, rim text) appearing on a reissued title — often used by collectors to date or authenticate copies.

**Etymology:** *Variant* label style tied to a *reissue* period.

**Example:** “The blue-rainbow Capitol label is a mid-’70s reissue label variant.”

**Cultural Note:** * Serious collectors track tiny print-ring and logo shifts to pinpoint exact year and plant.
