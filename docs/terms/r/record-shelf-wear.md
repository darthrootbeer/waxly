# Record Shelf

**Definition:** **noun / grading term.** Visible **rubbing or color loss** on jacket edges and corners from years of sliding in/out of shelves.

**Etymology:** Retail/collector slang: wear caused by *shelf* storage.

**Example:** “Light record shelf-wear along the spine keeps the jacket at VG+ instead of NM.”

**Cultural Note:** * One of the most common flaws affecting second-hand jacket grading.
