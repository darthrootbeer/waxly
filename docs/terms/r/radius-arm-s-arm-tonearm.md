# Radius Arm

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi term.** A **curved S-shaped tonearm** whose pivot radius helps minimize tracking-angle error across the disc.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — tonearm shaped to follow the groove’s *radius*.

**Example:** “The Technics SL-1200 uses a radius S-arm with detachable headshell.”

**Cultural Note:** * Favored on DJ and Japanese hi-fi decks since the ’70s; contrasts with straight arms and linear trackers.
