# Record-of-the-Month Club

**Definition:** **noun / retail history.** A **subscription-based service** that mailed curated records monthly — precursor to modern vinyl-subscription boxes.

**Etymology:** Plain: *record of the month* program.

**Example:** “Dad still has his ’70s jazz record-of-the-month club editions in matching mailers.”

**Cultural Note:** * A major channel for catalog sales pre-CD; today’s clubs mimic the tradition for vinyl revivalists.
