# Resonance Control Footers

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory.** Special **vibration-damping feet or cones** placed under turntables or amps to reduce **acoustic feedback and structural vibration**.

**Etymology:** Self-descriptive — footers designed to control *resonance*.

**Example:** “Adding sorbothane resonance-control footers cut foot-fall feedback on the springy wooden floor.”

**Cultural Note:** * A common audiophile tweak; club DJs often improvise with foam blocks or tennis balls.
