# Reinforced Groove

**Definition:** **noun / mastering slang.** A groove **cut deeper and wider** to survive heavy club or jukebox play — typical for disco 12-inches and some reggae/dub plates.

**Etymology:** Slang for a groove physically *reinforced* by deeper cut.

**Example:** “The reinforced groove on that Studio One 12-inch lets it track loud on battered club decks.”

**Cultural Note:** * Essential for sound-system culture where cheap cartridges and high tracking forces dominated.
