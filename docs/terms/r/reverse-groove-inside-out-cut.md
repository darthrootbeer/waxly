# Reverse Groove

**Definition:** **noun / novelty mastering trick.** A **record cut so that the stylus starts at the label and plays outward to the edge** — a mastering novelty occasionally used for special tracks.

**Etymology:** Plain — groove direction is *reversed*.

**Example:** “The Monty Python ‘Three-Sided’ LP hides a reverse-groove track that surprises new listeners.”

**Cultural Note:** * A collectible gimmick used by certain avant-garde, comedy, and prog-rock records.
