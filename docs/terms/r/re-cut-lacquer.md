# Re-Cut Lacquer

**Definition:** **noun / mastering term.** A **new lacquer master** cut after the original wore out, was damaged, or needed sonic/spacing adjustments.

**Etymology:** Literal — lacquer was *re-cut*.

**Example:** “The ‘-RE2’ matrix etching shows it’s the second re-cut lacquer.”

**Cultural Note:** * Matrix suffixes like RE-1, -2, etc., fascinate pressing-variation detectives.
