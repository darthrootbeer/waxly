# Re-Master

**Definition:** **noun / studio term.** A **newly mastered version** of an existing recording, often using improved tapes, EQ, or digital restoration.

**Etymology:** *Master* made again = *re-master*.

**Example:** “The 2009 remastered Beatles stereo LPs differ tonally from the ’60s tube-cut originals.”

**Cultural Note:** * A perpetual point of debate among collectors comparing eras of cuts.
