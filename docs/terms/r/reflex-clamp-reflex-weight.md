# Reflex Clamp

**Definition:** **noun / hi-fi accessory.** A **center-spindle clamp** with a cam-action “reflex” lever that locks the record tight to the platter and flattens dish-warps.

**Etymology:** Brand/tech descriptor — clamp locks by *reflex* cam pressure.

**Example:** “The reflex clamp locked the warped classical LP flat and reduced mid-band wow.”

**Cultural Note:** * Common on VPI and other high-end turntables since the ’80s.
