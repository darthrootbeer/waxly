# RIAA Curve (RIAA Playback Equalization)

**Definition:** **noun / technical standard.** The **industry-standard EQ curve** established by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1955 for consistent cutting and playback of LPs.

**Etymology:** Acronym: *RIAA* + *curve* for standardized EQ slope.

**Example:** “Every modern phono preamp applies the RIAA curve to restore flat response.”

**Cultural Note:** * Before 1955, labels used their own curves (AES, NAB, Columbia, etc.), so archival playback of older discs may need variable-EQ stages.
