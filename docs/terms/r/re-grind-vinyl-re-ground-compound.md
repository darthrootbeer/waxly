# Re-Grind Vinyl

**Definition:** **noun / manufacturing term.** Vinyl compound **made from ground-up scrap trimmings or returned records** blended back into new pressings — common in budget LPs.

**Etymology:** Industrial: *re-grind* = re-ground PVC reused for pressing.

**Example:** “The oil-crisis ’70s saw labels switching to cheaper re-grind vinyl — noisier surfaces resulted.”

**Cultural Note:** * Audiophiles hunt early virgin-compound pressings for lower noise-floor.
