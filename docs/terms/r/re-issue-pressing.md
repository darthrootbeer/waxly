# Re-Issue Pressing

**Definition:** **noun / market term.** A **later-edition pressing** of an album after the original release period — may use new stampers, new mastering, or new packaging.

**Etymology:** Plain: a title *issued* again = *re-issue*.

**Example:** “The 1982 blue-label re-issue pressing used a cheaper cover but kept the original metalwork.”

**Cultural Note:** * Some re-issues eclipse originals if cut from fresher tapes or better mastering engineers.
