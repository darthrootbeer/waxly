# Residual Static Pop

**Definition:** **noun / playback artifact.** An audible **snap or crackle** caused by **static-electric discharge** when the stylus first touches or leaves the groove.

**Etymology:** Plain — *static pop* that’s *residual* after cleaning.

**Example:** “A Zerostat gun helps kill the residual static pops on dry winter days.”

**Cultural Note:** * One of vinyl’s perennial annoyances; addressed by anti-static sleeves, brushes, and ionizing guns.
