# Reference Lacquer

**Definition:** **noun / mastering term.** A **one-off lacquer disc** cut directly from the mix as a **reference copy** for producers or artists to audition before committing to production.

**Etymology:** Plain — a lacquer made for *reference-listening*.

**Example:** “The engineer cut a reference lacquer overnight so the band could approve EQ choices.”

**Cultural Note:** * Rare survivors are prized historical artifacts capturing the original mastering decisions.
