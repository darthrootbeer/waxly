# X-Y Stereo Pickup Test

**Definition:** **noun / lab setup term.** A **test configuration where two cartridges are mounted at 90-degree (X-Y) axes** to evaluate channel separation and crosstalk — used by cartridge designers and archivists.

**Etymology:** Lab shorthand — measuring stereo signal in *X* and *Y* axes.

**Example:** “The archivist’s X-Y stereo pickup test revealed 28 dB separation at 1 kHz.”

**Cultural Note:** * Rarely encountered outside engineering or restoration labs.
