  "summary": "'**Dubstep** - A musical style within the Electronic genre, classified according.",
  "definition": "A bass-heavy electronic music genre that emerged from South London's underground club scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, characterized by syncopated rhythmic patterns, prominent sub-bass frequencies, and tempos typically around 140 BPM with half-time drum patterns. Pioneered by producers like Skream, Benga, and Digital Mystikz at venues such as FWD>> nightclub, dubstep evolved from UK garage, 2-step, and dub reggae influences. The genre's signature wobble bass and sparse, dark atmosphere dominated underground dance music before breaking mainstream around 2010 through artists like Skrillex, who popularized a more aggressive \"brostep\" variant. Original dubstep pressings on labels like DMZ, Hyperdub, and Tempa Records have become highly collectible among electronic music enthusiasts, with early 12-inch singles commanding premium prices. The genre's emphasis on sub-bass frequencies makes vinyl pressings particularly valued for their physical low-end reproduction, though mastering challenges exist due to extreme bass content potentially causing groove distortion or playback issues on poorly calibrated systems.",
