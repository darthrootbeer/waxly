  "pos": "noun",
  "pronunciation": "/ˈdʒeɪ kʌt ˈsɪŋɡəl/",
  "summary": "**noun / slang.** A record pressed with the lead-in groove unusually short.",
  "definition": "**noun / slang.** A record pressed with the lead-in groove unusually short — almost shaped like a \"J\" hugging the label — meaning the song starts very close to the label. This pressing technique emerged in the 1960s as labels sought to maximize playing time on 7-inch singles, particularly when cramming longer album tracks onto 45s. The abbreviated lead-in creates an abrupt visual transition from label to modulated groove, making these pressings instantly recognizable. DJs initially disliked J-cuts because the reduced cueing space made needle drops more difficult, requiring precise hand-eye coordination to avoid starting mid-phrase. The practice became more common in the 1970s with disco 12-inches and promotional singles where every second of groove real estate mattered. Collectors today view certain J-cut pressings as desirable variants, particularly on rare soul and funk 45s where the unusual cut sometimes indicates a specific pressing plant or early run. The term remains studio and collector slang rather than official pressing terminology.",
