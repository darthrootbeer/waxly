  "definition": "**noun / DIY slang.** Adding a coin (often a penny) atop the headshell to increase tracking force for skipping or worn records — a common home-user hack, not recommended for valuable vinyl. This improvised modification emerged in the 1960s-70s as budget turntable owners sought quick fixes for playback issues without understanding proper cartridge setup. A US penny adds approximately 2.5 grams of tracking force, while UK pennies vary by era (pre-1992 copper pennies: 3.56g, post-1992: 3.56g, current: 3.56g). The practice became widespread with cheap ceramic cartridges that could withstand 4-8 grams of tracking force, but causes accelerated groove wear and stylus damage on modern elliptical or microline styli calibrated for 1.5-2.5 grams. While sometimes effective for severely worn records or warped discs that skip with proper tracking force, penny-weighting destroys vinyl through excessive pressure, gouging grooves and creating permanent surface noise. Audiophiles and collectors universally condemn the practice. Proper solutions include stylus replacement, counterweight adjustment, or anti-skate calibration. The term persists in online forums as shorthand for ill-advised turntable modifications, alongside tape-fixing and stacking multiple records.",
