  "summary": "'**noun / retail remainder mark.** A **thin saw-blade cut in the LP jacket's.",
  "definition": "**noun / retail remainder mark.** A **thin saw-blade cut in the LP jacket's spine or edge** to indicate remaindered or discounted stock — akin to punch-hole and cut-corner marks. Typically measuring 1-3 inches in length, the saw-cut was made by retailers or distributors using circular or band saws to permanently mark unsold inventory being returned to labels or liquidated at reduced prices. This practice became widespread in the 1970s-80s during the industry's transition from vinyl to CD, when massive quantities of LPs flooded cutout bins. Unlike drill holes or corner clips that removed material, saw-cuts created distinctive notches along the jacket edge, often extending through the inner sleeve but rarely damaging the record itself. Collectors generally view saw-cuts as less desirable than unmarked copies, though they're preferable to more destructive remainder marks. The practice largely disappeared by the 1990s as vinyl production declined, making saw-cut copies valuable time capsules of the format's commercial twilight years.",
