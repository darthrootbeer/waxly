  "definition": "**noun / technical.** A counterweight system designed to maintain consistent tracking force across warped records by shifting mass dynamically as the tonearm rises or falls. Introduced in the 1960s as high-fidelity playback became more demanding, kinetic-balance systems addressed a critical problem: warped or slightly dished records cause vertical tonearm movement that traditional static counterweights cannot compensate for, resulting in tracking force fluctuations that damage grooves or cause mistracking. The kinetic-balance weight typically features a sliding or pivoting mass positioned closer to the tonearm pivot point than conventional counterweights, allowing it to respond to vertical motion while maintaining lateral balance. Some implementations use spring-loaded mechanisms or fluid-damped designs to smooth the response. Brands like SME and Ortofon developed sophisticated versions in the 1970s, though the technology never achieved widespread adoption due to complexity and cost. Critics argued that proper record storage and flat pressings rendered the system unnecessary, while proponents valued the reduced stylus wear on vintage or inevitably warped discs. Modern high-end tonearms occasionally revive the concept, particularly in markets where older vinyl collections with inherent warpage remain common. The system represents a peak-era attempt to engineer around real-world vinyl imperfections rather than simply demanding perfect source material.",
