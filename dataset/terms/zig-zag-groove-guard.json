  "definition": "**noun / packaging-mould feature.** A **slight zig-zag raised lip pattern on some LP edges or labels designed to keep stacked records' grooves from rubbing when sleeveless**. This protective feature emerged during the 1950s stack-changer era when consumers routinely stored multiple records together without individual sleeves, risking groove damage from direct vinyl-to-vinyl contact. The serrated or notched ridge—typically molded into the outer edge of the label area or the very rim of the disc—creates microscopic air gaps between stacked records, preventing the delicate spiral grooves from touching and accumulating surface noise or permanent wear. Most commonly found on budget labels and compilation releases where cost-cutting eliminated inner sleeves, the zig-zag pattern proved more effective than smooth raised rings, which could still allow slippage. By the late 1960s, as individual inner sleeves became standard and automatic changers declined in popularity, this mould feature gradually disappeared from pressing plant specifications, though some European pressings retained variations into the 1970s.",
