  "definition": "**noun / packaging style.** A **jacket or outer sleeve that opens along the top edge** instead of the standard right-side opening found on most Western LP covers. This packaging format became the default for UK pressings from the 1950s through the mid-1970s, when British labels gradually transitioned to side-loading designs to align with international standards. Japanese pressings have maintained the top-loader format through the present day, often featuring OBI strips along the spine that would be obscured by side-opening designs. The format offers practical advantages for retail display—allowing cover art to remain fully visible when filed vertically—and provides better protection against ring wear along the opening edge. Collectors often prize original UK and Japanese top-loaders for their distinctive regional character and superior preservation of cover artwork. Modern reissue labels occasionally employ top-loader designs as an authenticity marker when recreating vintage pressings or as a premium packaging choice for audiophile editions.",
