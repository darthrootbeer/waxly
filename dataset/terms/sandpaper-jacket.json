  "definition": "**noun / infamous packaging.** A **LP jacket literally covered in coarse sandpaper** — most notoriously the 1981 Factory Records pressing of *The Return of the Durutti Column*, which scratched adjacent LPs in the stack. Designed by Peter Saville as a conceptual art piece, the abrasive sleeve was intended to physically interact with its environment, creating unique wear patterns on neighboring records. The original run of 2,000 copies featured industrial-grade sandpaper glued to the outer sleeve, making storage a destructive act. Factory boss Tony Wilson famously remarked that the packaging cost more than the recording itself. While a handful of other experimental releases have employed sandpaper elements, the Durutti Column sleeve remains the definitive example of packaging-as-provocation. Original copies command premium prices among collectors, though many show significant sandpaper degradation. Reissues typically omit the abrasive surface, replacing it with printed reproductions.",
