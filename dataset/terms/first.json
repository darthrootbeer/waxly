  "summary": "The earliest commercial pressing run of a release — usually cut closest to.",
  "definition": "The earliest commercial pressing run of a release — usually cut closest to the original master lacquer before metal parts wear or mastering changes occur. First pressings are typically cut from the freshest stampers and fathers, resulting in superior sound quality with less surface noise and better dynamic range. Identifying features include original catalog numbers, early matrix inscriptions, and period-correct label designs. Many landmark albums saw significant quality degradation in later pressings as stampers wore down or masters were recut for cost efficiency. Collectors prize first pressings for both sonic superiority and historical authenticity, particularly for jazz, classic rock, and audiophile releases where mastering differences are pronounced. Notable examples include UK Parlophone Beatles pressings and Blue Note deep groove editions, which command premium prices due to their proximity to the original recording session tapes.",
