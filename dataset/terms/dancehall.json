  "summary": "'**Dancehall** - A musical style within the Reggae genre, classified according.",
  "definition": "A high-energy subgenre of reggae that emerged in Jamaica during the late 1970s, characterized by stripped-down rhythms, digital production, and DJ-led vocal delivery over sparse instrumental tracks. Named after the venues where sound systems played, dancehall marked a decisive shift from roots reggae's live instrumentation to synthesized beats and drum machines, particularly after the introduction of the Casio CZ-101 and Yamaha DX100 in the mid-1980s. The genre's vinyl releases became essential weapons in sound clash culture, with exclusive dubplates and pre-release pressings commanding significant respect and collector value. Pioneered by producers like King Jammy and artists such as Yellowman, Shabba Ranks, and Buju Banton, dancehall's riddim-based production style—where multiple artists voice different tracks over the same instrumental—created a unique vinyl ecosystem of 7-inch and 12-inch singles. The genre's influence extends beyond reggae into hip-hop, electronic music, and contemporary pop, with original Jamaican pressings from the 1980s golden era highly sought by collectors and DJs.",
