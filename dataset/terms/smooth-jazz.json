  "summary": "'**Smooth Jazz** - A musical style within the Jazz genre, classified according.",
  "definition": "A commercially-oriented subgenre of jazz that emerged in the late 1970s and gained mainstream popularity throughout the 1980s-1990s, characterized by polished production, melodic accessibility, and reduced improvisational complexity compared to traditional jazz forms. Smooth jazz typically features electric instruments, synthesizers, and a steady rhythm section, prioritizing listener-friendly hooks over experimental or avant-garde elements. The style became synonymous with radio formats targeting adult contemporary audiences, with artists like George Benson, Grover Washington Jr., and Kenny G achieving crossover success. On vinyl, smooth jazz releases from the genre's peak era (1980s-1990s) often showcase pristine pressing quality and dynamic range that highlight the studio-crafted production values, though the genre remains less sought-after among jazz purist collectors compared to bebop, hard bop, or modal jazz pressings.",
