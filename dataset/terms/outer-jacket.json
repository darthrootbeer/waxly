  "summary": "'**noun / packaging.** The main printed cover that holds both the inner sleeve.",
  "definition": "**noun / packaging.** The main printed cover that holds both the inner sleeve and the record — sometimes protected by an additional clear poly outer sleeve. Typically constructed from cardboard stock weighing 300-350 gsm, the outer jacket serves as the primary canvas for album artwork, liner notes, and catalog information. Introduced alongside the 12-inch LP format in 1948, jacket design evolved from simple text-based covers to elaborate gatefold constructions and die-cut innovations throughout the 1960s and 70s. The condition of the outer jacket significantly impacts a record's collector value, with grading systems (Mint, VG+, VG, etc.) accounting for seam splits, ring wear, corner dings, and spine damage. Modern reissues often feature tip-on gatefold jackets that replicate vintage printing techniques, while original pressings with intact shrink wrap and hype stickers command premium prices. The jacket's square format (12.375 x 12.375 inches standard) established album cover art as a legitimate creative medium, launching the careers of designers like Reid Miles, Hipgnosis, and Storm Thorgerson.",
