  "summary": "'**noun / mastering term.** A **new lacquer master** cut after the original.",
  "definition": "**noun / mastering term.** A **new lacquer master** cut after the original wore out, was damaged, or needed sonic/spacing adjustments. Lacquer masters are delicate aluminum discs coated with nitrocellulose, designed for single-use cutting before electroplating to create stampers. When original lacquers deteriorate or when labels need additional pressing runs beyond the stamper lifespan (typically 1,000-1,500 records), mastering engineers re-cut from the original master tape or safety copy. Re-cuts may differ sonically from first-generation pressings due to tape degradation, different cutting equipment, or engineer interpretation—making original pressings from first lacquers highly prized by collectors. Matrix number variations often reveal re-cut lacquers through stamper code suffixes or different engineer marks. Major reissue campaigns and high-demand titles frequently require multiple re-cuts across decades, each potentially introducing subtle sonic variations that fuel audiophile debates about definitive pressings.",
