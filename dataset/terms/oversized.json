  "definition": "**noun / historical / novelty.** A slightly larger-than-standard disc — typically 13 inches in diameter — produced primarily for transcription services, radio station use, or promotional purposes from the 1940s through the 1970s. These discs required specialized turntables or manual cueing adjustments, as standard 12-inch platters couldn't accommodate the extra inch. Radio transcription discs often used this format to maximize playing time for syndicated programming, while promotional singles occasionally adopted the size for visual impact and shelf presence. The format never achieved widespread commercial adoption due to incompatibility with consumer playback equipment. Examples include certain Muzak background music discs and promotional pressings for jukeboxes that featured oversized mechanisms. Today, 13-inch discs command collector interest primarily for their novelty value and rarity, though playback requires either vintage professional equipment or careful manual positioning on modern turntables with sufficient platter clearance.",
