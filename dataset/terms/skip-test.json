  "definition": "**noun / [cartridge](../c/cartridge.md)-setup term.** A **special test-record band cut at extreme velocity** to evaluate a cartridge's tracking ability without skipping. These high-amplitude grooves—typically cut at +18dB to +24dB above standard levels—push a stylus to its mechanical limits, revealing whether tracking force, anti-skate, and cartridge compliance are properly calibrated. Introduced in the 1960s alongside precision test records from manufacturers like Shure (TTR-103, TTR-115) and CBS STR series, skip-tests became essential tools for dealers demonstrating cartridge performance and audiophiles fine-tuning their rigs. The most notorious band is the Shure \"Torture Track\" at 80 microns peak velocity, which only premium cartridges could navigate cleanly. Modern skip-tests appear on contemporary test LPs from Analogue Productions and Mobile Fidelity, though many vintage pressings remain the gold standard. Successfully passing a skip-test without audible distortion or mistracking indicates optimal setup; failure signals excessive tracking force, worn stylus, or fundamental cartridge inadequacy. Collectors prize original test records, with sealed Shure TTR-series discs commanding $100-$300, while the practice remains vital for serious turntable setup despite digital calibration alternatives.",
