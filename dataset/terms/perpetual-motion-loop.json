  "summary": "'**noun / novelty / experimental.** A creatively cut locked groove designed.",
  "definition": "**noun / novelty / experimental.** A creatively cut [locked groove](../l/locked-groove.md) designed to repeat a rhythmic or melodic phrase endlessly until the needle is lifted. Unlike standard locked grooves that simply loop surface noise or silence at a record's end, perpetual motion loops are intentionally composed musical elements—often a drum break, vocal snippet, or melodic motif—carved to create seamless repetition. The technique emerged in the experimental music scene of the 1960s-70s, with artists like The Beatles (\"Sgt. Pepper's\" run-out groove) and Pink Floyd incorporating cryptic looping messages. The practice gained renewed interest in the 1990s-2000s among electronic and hip-hop producers who appreciated the analog precursor to digital sampling loops. Cutting a convincing perpetual motion loop requires precise lathe work to ensure the phrase's end point matches its beginning without audible clicks or rhythm disruption. Modern pressing plants occasionally use them as Easter eggs on deluxe reissues, though their novelty has diminished in the streaming era.",
