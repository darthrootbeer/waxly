  "summary": "'**Romantic** - A musical style within the Classical genre, classified according.",
  "definition": "A musical style period within classical music spanning roughly 1820-1900, characterized by emotional expressiveness, expanded orchestration, and individualistic compositional approaches. The Romantic era produced some of the most frequently pressed classical vinyl, with composers like Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, and Wagner dominating catalog reissues from the 1950s onward. Major labels like Deutsche Grammophon, Decca, and RCA Living Stereo built their reputations on Romantic repertoire recordings, particularly large-scale symphonies and concertos that showcased stereo separation and dynamic range. Audiophile pressings of Romantic works remain highly collectible, with early stereo recordings from the late 1950s and early 1960s commanding premium prices. The genre's dramatic crescendos and quiet passages make Romantic classical records ideal test material for evaluating turntable performance and cartridge tracking ability.",
