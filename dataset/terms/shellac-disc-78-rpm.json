  "pos": "noun",
  "pronunciation": "/ʃəˈlæk dɪsk/",
  "summary": "noun / historical format. A pre-vinyl disc made of shellac and mineral filler,.",
  "definition": "**noun / historical format.** A **pre-vinyl disc** made from shellac resin (derived from lac beetles) mixed with mineral fillers like slate dust and cotton flock, typically **10-inch or 12-inch 78 RPM** records produced from the 1890s through early 1950s. These discs are notably **brittle and heavy** (≈ 5-7 oz), with wide grooves (≈ 3 mil stylus width) requiring steel or thorn needles that wore down after each play. Shellac's limited frequency response (≈ 5 kHz) and surface noise defined early recorded sound. Production peaked in the 1920s-40s, dominating jazz, blues, and classical releases before vinyl's superior fidelity and durability displaced them by 1955. Collectors prize rare pressings—especially pre-war blues and jazz 78s—though playback demands period-appropriate equipment or modern 78 RPM-capable turntables with proper stylus profiles to avoid groove damage. Original shellac pressings often command higher prices than later vinyl reissues for their historical authenticity.",
