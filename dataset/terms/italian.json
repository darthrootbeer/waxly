  "summary": "noun / collector term. Any record manufactured in Italy — often identifiable.",
  "definition": "**noun / collector term.** Any record manufactured in Italy, typically identifiable by distinctive visual and manufacturing characteristics including the SIAE (Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori) copyright stamp, ornate label typography, and unique laminated or glossy sleeves uncommon elsewhere. Italian pressings gained particular reverence among collectors for their mastering quality on 1970s progressive rock, jazz, and film soundtrack releases, often exhibiting warmer, more dynamic sound compared to UK or US counterparts. Major Italian plants like Fonit Cetra, Vedette, and CGD developed house styles that influenced European manufacturing. Labels such as RCA Italiana, Ricordi, and Durium produced sought-after editions of international releases with distinct artwork and sometimes alternate takes. The country's strong film and library music industry also made Italy a hub for obscure soundtrack pressings. Modern collectors prize Italian editions for both sonic qualities and distinctive packaging, though condition varies widely due to thinner vinyl stock used by some manufacturers during the 1970s oil crisis.",
