  "definition": "**noun / technical.** A turntable whose tonearm moves straight across the record's radius on a rail or track, maintaining a near-perfect tangential angle to the groove throughout playback. Unlike pivoting tonearms that trace an arc, linear-tracking designs replicate the geometry of the cutting lathe that originally inscribed the record, theoretically eliminating tracking-angle error and inner-groove distortion. First popularized in the late 1970s and early 1980s by manufacturers like Bang & Olufsen, Technics, and Revox, these turntables employed various mechanisms—servo motors, air bearings, or magnetic drives—to move the cartridge horizontally. The B&O Beogram series became iconic for their sleek, low-profile aesthetics and tangential tracking precision. High-end models like the Goldmund Reference and Rockport Sirius used air-bearing systems for virtually frictionless movement, commanding prices exceeding $100,000. Despite their theoretical advantages, linear trackers proved maintenance-intensive, requiring precise calibration and often suffering from motor noise or mechanical complexity. Most mass-market models disappeared by the 1990s, though audiophile manufacturers continue producing ultra-high-end versions. Vintage linear-tracking turntables remain sought after by collectors for their futuristic design and unique engineering, though many require specialized service to maintain optimal performance.",
