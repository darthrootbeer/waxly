  "definition": "A single released on 12-inch (or occasionally 10-inch) vinyl with extended mixes, bonus tracks, or multiple B-sides — usually aimed at DJs and club play. Emerging in the mid-1970s as disco culture demanded longer, uninterrupted dance tracks, the maxi-single capitalized on the superior fidelity and extended groove space of the 12-inch format. Unlike standard 7-inch singles with radio edits, maxis typically feature remixes running 6-12 minutes, often with instrumental and dub versions that allow DJs to mix seamlessly. The format became essential in dance, hip-hop, and electronic music throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with labels pressing promotional copies for club DJs alongside retail versions. Maxi-singles often included exclusive non-album tracks, making them highly collectible. While digital distribution has diminished their commercial necessity, the format persists in contemporary electronic and dance music releases, valued for its sonic superiority and DJ-friendly features like wider grooves that improve tracking and bass response.",
