  "definition": "**noun / format.** A 1970s-era vinyl format engineered to deliver **four-channel surround sound** when played through compatible decoders and amplifiers. Three competing encoding systems dominated the market: **SQ** (CBS/Columbia's matrix system), **QS** (Sansui's matrix approach), and **CD-4** (JVC's discrete carrier-based format requiring specialized styli and extended frequency response to 45kHz). The format peaked between 1971-1976, with major labels releasing quad mixes of rock, jazz, and classical titles before incompatible standards and high equipment costs doomed commercial viability. Pink Floyd's *Dark Side of the Moon*, Santana's *Abraxas*, and numerous classical recordings received quad treatments. Today, quad LPs command collector premiums, particularly CD-4 pressings, though many lack functioning playback equipment. The format's ambition influenced later surround formats and remains a fascinating footnote in hi-fi history.",
