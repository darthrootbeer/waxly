  "definition": "**noun / mastering slang.** A quick QC method where engineers drag a soft pencil (typically 2B or softer graphite) across a test lacquer's groove to feel for uniform depth or ridges. The pencil's tip would catch on inconsistencies, revealing cutting defects, uneven groove spacing, or depth variations that could cause playback issues in the final pressing. Mastering engineers used this tactile inspection during the lacquer-cutting era (1940s–1980s) before sending reference acetates to pressing plants. The technique required a delicate touch — too much pressure could damage the lacquer, too little would miss subtle flaws. As digital QC tools and microscopic inspection became standard in the 1990s, the pencil test faded from daily practice. Some old-school cutting engineers still employ it for quick spot-checks on dubplates or limited-run lacquers, valuing the immediate tactile feedback over visual inspection alone. Rarely discussed outside mastering studios, it represents the hands-on craftsmanship of analog record production.",
