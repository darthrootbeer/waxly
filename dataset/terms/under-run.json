  "definition": "**noun / manufacturing slang.** A **pressing run that produced fewer copies than planned**, often due to plant shutdown, contract limit, or cancelled order. Under-runs typically occur when a pressing plant experiences equipment failure mid-run, when a label cancels an order after production begins, or when contractual minimums are reached but demand doesn't justify completing the full quantity. Unlike intentional limited editions, under-runs are accidental scarcities that can significantly increase collector value, particularly for sought-after titles. Plants historically absorbed the cost difference, though contracts often included tolerance clauses allowing 5-10% variance. In the 1970s oil crisis, under-runs became common as vinyl shortages forced plants to ration materials. Modern reissue labels sometimes discover original pressings were under-runs when researching production histories, explaining why certain first pressings command premium prices despite no contemporary indication of limited quantities.",
