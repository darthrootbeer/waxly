  "definition": "**noun / club-DJ hack / slang.** Marking a small dot or line on the vinyl's surface (outside the lead-in groove) with a Sharpie or similar permanent marker to locate cue points visually in low-light DJ booths. Emerged in club culture during the 1980s-90s when battle DJs and hip-hop turntablists needed instant visual reference for breaks, scratches, and drops without relying on label artwork alone. The practice involves marking the record's dead wax or run-out area rather than the playing surface itself, though careless application can damage grooves. Common in scratch and battle scenes where split-second timing is critical, but controversial among collectors and purists who view any marking as defacement. Modern alternatives include removable sticker dots and UV-reactive markers, though many veteran DJs still swear by the original Sharpie method for its visibility under colored club lighting.",
