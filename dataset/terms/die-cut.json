  "term": "Die-Cut Sleeve",
  "pos": "noun",
  "pronunciation": "/daɪ kʌt sliːv/",
  "summary": "A jacket with a deliberate cut-out window—showing part of the record label.",
  "definition": "A record jacket featuring a precisely manufactured cut-out window, typically circular or shaped, that reveals the label information or artwork beneath. The term derives from the industrial die-cutting process, where a sharp steel die stamps through the cardboard sleeve during production. Die-cut sleeves emerged in the late 1940s as record labels sought cost-effective generic packaging—a single die-cut design could accommodate any artist or release by displaying the label through the window. The most common form is the center-hole die-cut, showing the label's logo and catalog number, though some feature shaped windows (guitars, keyholes, abstract designs) for artistic effect. Major labels like Columbia, Capitol, and Atlantic used standardized die-cut sleeves extensively through the 1950s-70s for singles and promotional copies. While generic die-cuts reduced packaging costs, they also limited album art possibilities, contributing to their decline as gatefold and full-color printing became standard. Today, die-cut sleeves appear primarily in reissues honoring original pressings, indie releases pursuing vintage aesthetics, or special editions where the cut-out creates intentional visual interplay between outer sleeve and inner label or picture disc.",
