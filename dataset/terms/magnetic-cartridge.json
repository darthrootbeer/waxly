  "definition": "**noun / technical.** A phono cartridge that uses a moving magnet (or iron) interacting with fixed coils to generate an electrical signal — the dominant design since the mid-20th century. As the stylus traces the record groove, its movements cause either a magnet to move past stationary coils (moving magnet/MM) or a piece of iron to move within a magnetic field (moving iron/MI), inducing voltage that corresponds to the recorded audio. Magnetic cartridges replaced ceramic designs in the 1950s-60s, offering superior frequency response and reduced record wear. Moving magnet cartridges became the industry standard due to their robust construction, user-replaceable styli, and output levels (3-6mV) compatible with standard phono preamps. They typically cost $50-$500, with models like the Shure M97xE and Audio-Technica VM95 series representing the reliable workhorse category. Moving iron variants, championed by Grado and some vintage manufacturers, use a fixed magnet with a moving iron armature, offering a middle ground between MM and MC designs. Modern magnetic cartridges remain the most popular choice for turntable owners, balancing performance, affordability, and ease of setup without requiring step-up transformers or specialized preamp gain settings.",
