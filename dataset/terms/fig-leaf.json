  "definition": "**noun / slang.** A censored variant picture-sleeve that hides nudity or controversial artwork — prized by collectors for its rarity. These alternative sleeves emerged in the 1960s when retailers or distributors demanded modifications to provocative album covers, resulting in airbrushed versions, strategic overlays, or completely redesigned artwork. Famous examples include the original \"butcher cover\" of The Beatles' *Yesterday and Today* (replaced with a trunk photo) and Blind Faith's self-titled album (censored in some markets). The term derives from the biblical fig leaf used to cover nakedness. Fig-leaf variants typically appeared in conservative markets or chain stores while uncensored versions sold in independent shops, creating parallel distribution streams. Today, both censored and uncensored versions command collector interest, though the original controversial artwork usually fetches higher prices. The censored variants themselves have become cultural artifacts documenting changing attitudes toward artistic expression and commercial compromise. Some collectors pursue both versions to document the full release history.",
