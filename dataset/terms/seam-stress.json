  "definition": "**noun / collector slang.** A tongue-in-cheek term for **severe ring-wear and seam damage** on well-traveled jackets. The phrase emerged in online collector communities during the early 2010s as a humorous way to acknowledge the inevitable wear patterns that appear on vintage records that have changed hands frequently or spent decades in circulation. The term combines two distinct forms of jacket deterioration: ring-wear (circular impressions caused by the record pressing against the cover) and seam splits (tears along the glued edges), suggesting these battle scars indicate a record's active life rather than careful storage. Collectors often use the term self-deprecatingly when describing their own acquisitions or diplomatically when listing condition issues in sales posts. While serious grading systems treat such damage as value-reducing flaws, the playful terminology reflects a subset of collectors who prioritize musical content and provenance over pristine cosmetics, viewing heavily worn jackets as badges of a record's cultural journey through multiple owners, cities, and eras.",
