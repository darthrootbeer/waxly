  "summary": "'**noun / slang.** A rare cutting-lathe mishap where the groove briefly swerves.",
  "definition": "**noun / slang.** A rare cutting-lathe mishap where the groove briefly swerves sideways forming a distinctive \"hook\" or \"J\" shape, causing an audible click, pop, or stylus mistrack during playback. This defect typically occurs during the lacquer cutting process when the lathe's cutting head experiences a momentary mechanical disturbance—vibration from external sources, a sudden feedback spike, or microscopic debris interfering with the cutting stylus. The resulting hook-shaped deviation disrupts the groove's continuous spiral, forcing the stylus to jump laterally before resuming normal tracking. J-cuts are most commonly found on test pressings and early lacquer transfers, rarely making it to production runs due to quality control. Collectors sometimes encounter them on small-run independent releases or bootlegs cut on poorly maintained equipment. Unlike intentional locked grooves, J-cuts are always unintentional defects that diminish playback quality and, in severe cases, can damage stylus cantilevers on high-compliance cartridges.",
