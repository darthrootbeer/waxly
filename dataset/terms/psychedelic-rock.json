  "summary": "'**Psychedelic Rock** - A musical style within the Rock genre, classified.",
  "definition": "A rock music subgenre characterized by distorted guitars, extended instrumental passages, experimental studio effects, and lyrics inspired by psychedelic drug experiences. Emerged from mid-1960s counterculture movements in San Francisco, London, and Los Angeles, with bands employing reverb, phasing, feedback, and backwards tape effects to simulate altered consciousness. Key artists include Pink Floyd, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jefferson Airplane, and The Doors, who pushed recording boundaries at studios like Abbey Road and Capitol. The genre's peak (1966-1969) produced landmark albums pressed with elaborate gatefold artwork and vibrant color schemes that complemented the sonic experimentation. Original pressings from this era, particularly UK and US first issues, command premium prices among collectors for their superior mastering and dynamic range. The style influenced progressive rock, heavy metal, and modern neo-psychedelia revivalists, with contemporary reissue labels like Sundazed and Anthology Recordings preserving the genre's vinyl legacy through high-quality pressings.",
