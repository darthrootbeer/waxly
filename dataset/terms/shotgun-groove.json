  "definition": "**noun / mastering slang.** A **hot, extra-wide groove cut** to maximize volume and bass punch for club/disco singles — trades off side length for amplitude headroom. Mastering engineers would intentionally space grooves farther apart and cut at higher amplitudes to create records that jumped out of jukeboxes and club sound systems in the 1970s disco era. The technique required sacrificing playing time (often limiting sides to 4-6 minutes) but delivered dramatic dynamic range and low-frequency impact that standard groove spacing couldn't achieve. Named for its aggressive, explosive sonic character, the shotgun groove became essential for 12-inch disco singles where maximum impact mattered more than duration. Modern reissue labels occasionally employ shotgun cutting for authentic reproductions of dance classics, though digital mastering has largely replaced the need for such extreme physical compromises. Collectors prize original shotgun-cut disco pressings for their unmatched visceral punch.",
