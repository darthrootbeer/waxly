  "definition": "**noun / DJ slang.** A **fast-paced dance track guaranteed to fill the floor** — not format-specific but deeply tied to vinyl-DJ party sets. Emerged from disco and funk DJ culture in the 1970s when selectors learned to read crowd energy and deploy high-BPM records (typically 120+ BPM) to maximize dancefloor participation. The term emphasizes both tempo (driving rhythm that compels movement) and proven crowd response, distinguishing these tracks from experimental or warm-up selections. Classic examples span genres: disco anthems, Northern Soul stompers, house bangers, and drum & bass rollers. Experienced vinyl DJs maintain dedicated crates of floor-fillers for peak-hour deployment, often on 12-inch singles for maximum sonic impact. The concept remains central to DJ craft despite digital transition, as reading a room and selecting the right up-tempo moment separates competent selectors from masters of the dancefloor.",
