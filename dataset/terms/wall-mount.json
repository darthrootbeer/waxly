  "definition": "**noun / hi-fi accessory.** A **rigid shelf mounted directly to a load-bearing wall** to isolate a turntable from foot-fall vibration and bouncy floors. By anchoring into wall studs rather than resting on floor-supported furniture, wall-mount shelves mechanically decouple the turntable from structure-borne vibrations that cause feedback, mistracking, and muddied bass response. The concept gained traction in the 1970s among serious audiophiles dealing with suspended wooden floors in older homes, where even careful footsteps could send the tonearm skipping. Modern wall-mount shelves range from simple MDF brackets to elaborate designs incorporating constrained-layer damping, mass-loaded platforms, and adjustable leveling mechanisms. High-end models from manufacturers like Salamander Archetype and custom fabricators use butcher-block maple, tempered glass, or composite materials optimized for resonance control. Installation requires locating studs and ensuring the shelf can support 40-75 pounds depending on turntable weight. Particularly effective for belt-drive decks sensitive to low-frequency rumble, though proper wall construction is critical—mounting to drywall alone or flimsy walls negates benefits. Remains the gold-standard isolation solution for challenging acoustic environments where floor-standing racks prove inadequate.",
