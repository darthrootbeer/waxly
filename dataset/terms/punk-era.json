  "summary": "'**noun / cultural collector tag.** A 7-inch single released during the original.",
  "definition": "**noun / cultural collector tag.** A 7-inch single released during the original late-'70s punk explosion — roughly 1976-1981 — frequently on tiny independent labels with photocopied or Xeroxed sleeves, hand-stamped centers, and raw production values. These singles embodied punk's DIY ethos, with bands bypassing major labels to press 500-1000 copies on shoestring budgets. Iconic examples include early releases on Stiff, Rough Trade, Fast Product, and countless regional micro-labels that folded after one or two releases. Pressings were often crude: thin vinyl, off-center holes, inconsistent audio levels. Original punk-era 7-inches now command premium prices in the collector market, particularly first pressings with original inserts, posters, or badges. Condition matters less than provenance — even thrashed copies of rare singles fetch hundreds or thousands. The term distinguishes authentic period pieces from later reissues and post-punk releases, marking a specific cultural moment when the 7-inch format was punk's primary medium before the LP became standard.",
