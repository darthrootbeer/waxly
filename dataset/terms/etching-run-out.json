  "pos": "noun",
  "pronunciation": "/ˈɛtʃɪŋ/",
  "summary": "Hand-scratched marks, initials, or messages in the dead-wax/run-out area.",
  "definition": "Hand-scratched marks, initials, or messages inscribed in the dead-wax or run-out groove area of a vinyl record, typically identifying mastering or cutting engineers, studio codes, or personal notes. These etchings are carved into the lacquer master during the cutting process using a stylus or scribe, becoming a permanent part of every pressing from that stamper. Engineers like George Peckham (\"Porky Prime Cuts\"), Chris Bellman, and Bob Ludwig developed signature styles, with some adding cryptic messages, song lyrics, or inside jokes that became collectible identifiers. Run-out etchings serve both practical purposes—tracking which engineer cut which side for quality control—and cultural ones, as collectors use them to identify first pressings, specific mastering chains, or desirable cuts. Famous examples include The Beatles' white album numbered editions and countless punk and indie releases with irreverent messages. Modern pressings continue this tradition, with audiophile reissues often prominently crediting cutting engineers in the run-out area.",
