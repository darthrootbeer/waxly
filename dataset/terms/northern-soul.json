  "summary": "'**Northern Soul** - A musical style within the Soul genre, classified according.",
  "definition": "A rare groove subgenre of soul music characterized by uptempo, danceable tracks from the mid-1960s through mid-1970s, primarily American releases that achieved cult status in Northern England rather than mainstream success. The scene emerged in working-class clubs like Wigan Casino and Blackpool Mecca during the early 1970s, where DJs championed obscure Motown, Atlantic, and independent label 45s featuring driving beats, tambourine-heavy percussion, and gospel-influenced vocals. Original pressings became highly sought commodities, with collectors traveling globally to unearth unplayed warehouse stock and personal collections. The movement established the all-nighter format, athletic dance styles, and a purist ethos demanding original vinyl over reissues or bootlegs. Northern Soul's emphasis on rarity transformed record collecting into competitive sport, with certain titles commanding four-figure sums. The scene influenced UK mod revival, rare groove culture, and modern crate-digging practices, maintaining dedicated followings through revival events and specialist labels reissuing authenticated pressings for contemporary dancers and collectors.",
