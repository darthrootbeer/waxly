  "summary": "'**Experimental** - A broad musical genre classification from the Discogs.",
  "definition": "A broad musical genre classification used in the Discogs database system to categorize music that challenges conventional composition, structure, and sonic boundaries. Emerged as a distinct categorization in the 1960s alongside avant-garde classical works, electronic music pioneers, and improvisation-based performances. The tag encompasses diverse subgenres including noise, drone, musique concrète, sound collage, and free improvisation. Artists like John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and later industrial and experimental rock acts pushed vinyl as a medium for unconventional sounds—locked grooves, field recordings, and extreme frequency ranges. Discogs uses Experimental as both a primary genre and secondary style descriptor, often paired with Electronic, Rock, or Jazz. Collectors prize experimental vinyl for limited pressings, unique packaging, and historical significance in pushing sonic boundaries. The classification remains intentionally broad to accommodate music that defies traditional genre categorization.",
