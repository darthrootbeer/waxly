  "definition": "**noun / collector term.** A circular ridge or indent left on the paper label by the center-dome of the press, created when the heated stamper compresses the vinyl biscuit and label together. The diameter, depth, and profile of pressing rings vary significantly between manufacturing plants and eras, making them valuable identifiers for collectors authenticating pressings. Early Columbia records feature distinctive 1.5-inch rings, while RCA pressings often show wider 2-inch variants. Some plants used flat-profile domes creating subtle impressions, while others employed aggressive domes leaving pronounced ridges that can affect label appearance. Japanese pressings typically exhibit minimal rings due to precision tooling. Collectors reference pressing ring characteristics alongside matrix numbers and label variations to determine pressing plant origin, distinguish first pressings from reissues, and identify specific manufacturing periods. Modern audiophile reissues sometimes replicate vintage ring patterns to maintain period authenticity, though contemporary automated presses generally produce lighter, more uniform impressions than their mid-century counterparts.",
