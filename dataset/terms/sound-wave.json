  "definition": "**noun / packaging gimmick.** A **decorative graphic of the song's waveform** etched into dead-wax areas or printed across the jacket — purely visual flair. These representations of audio amplitude over time emerged in the 2010s as labels sought Instagram-friendly packaging elements. The waveform may correspond to the actual audio on the record or be entirely fictional. Dead-wax etchings appear on single-sided LPs or in the run-out groove area, where a laser engraver burns the pattern into the lacquer master. Jacket versions typically feature the waveform as spot-varnish, foil-stamping, or printed graphics across gatefolds. While sonically meaningless — the etching produces no sound and the visual bears no relationship to the physical groove modulation — collectors prize elaborate examples. Jack White's Third Man Records popularized the technique with holographic and multi-color variants. Modern pressings frequently combine waveform graphics with other visual gimmicks like colored vinyl or picture discs, maximizing shelf appeal over sonic consideration.",
