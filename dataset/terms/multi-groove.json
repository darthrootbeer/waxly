  "summary": "'**noun / novelty / technical.** A gimmick disc with two or more parallel.",
  "definition": "**noun / novelty / technical.** A gimmick disc with two or more parallel grooves cut on the same side so that dropping the needle randomly plays one of several entirely different tracks. Pioneered by American Columbia Records in the 1930s and refined in the 1960s-80s, the technique requires precise lathe-cutting to space grooves close enough that the stylus cannot choose between them, creating unpredictable playback. Most famously employed on The Monkees' *Head* soundtrack (1968), Zayn's *Mind of Mine* (2016), and numerous comedy records where different punchlines played depending on needle drop. The manufacturing complexity and quality control challenges made multi-groove pressings expensive and rare. Grooves typically converge after the initial parallel section to prevent stylus damage. Modern pressings occasionally revive the format as a deluxe edition novelty, though digital-era listeners often miss the gimmick entirely. Collectors prize multi-groove records for their technical ingenuity and the unique listening experience of never knowing which version will play.",
