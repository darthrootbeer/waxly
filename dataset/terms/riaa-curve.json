  "pos": "noun",
  "pronunciation": "/ˈɑːr.aɪ.eɪ.eɪ kɜːrv/",
  "summary": "'**noun / technical standard.** The **industry-standard EQ curve** established.",
  "definition": "**noun / technical standard.** The **industry-standard EQ curve** established by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1955 for consistent cutting and playback of LPs. During cutting, bass frequencies are reduced and treble boosted to prevent groove overcrowding and improve signal-to-noise ratio; on playback, a phono preamp applies the inverse curve, restoring flat response. The standard specifies time constants of 3180μs (bass turnover at 50Hz), 318μs (treble rolloff at 500Hz), and 75μs (high-frequency rolloff at 2122Hz). Before 1955, competing curves from Columbia, Decca, and others caused playback inconsistencies; RIAA standardization enabled universal compatibility. Modern phono stages implement this equalization, though deviations existed into the 1970s—some UK Decca pressings used modified curves. Accurate RIAA implementation remains critical for proper tonal balance, making phono preamp quality essential for audiophile playback. Vintage equipment sometimes featured switchable curves for pre-RIAA records.",
