  "pos": "noun",
  "pronunciation": "/ˈiːkwəl ˈlaʊdnəs kɜːrv/",
  "summary": "A frequency-response graph (e.g., Fletcher-Munson) showing how human hearing.",
  "definition": "A frequency-response graph showing how human hearing perceives different frequencies at varying sound pressure levels, most famously documented in the Fletcher-Munson curves of 1933 and later refined as ISO 226 equal-loudness contours. The curves reveal that human ears are less sensitive to bass and treble frequencies at low volumes, requiring significant boost (10-15 dB at 50 Hz) to sound as loud as midrange frequencies. This psychoacoustic phenomenon profoundly influenced vinyl mastering decisions, as engineers compensated by emphasizing midrange presence on quieter passages. The curves also shaped tone-control design on amplifiers and receivers from the 1950s onward, with \"loudness\" buttons applying bass/treble boost at low volumes to counteract the effect. Understanding equal-loudness curves remains essential for mastering engineers cutting lacquers, as vinyl's dynamic range limitations require careful frequency balancing that accounts for typical playback volumes in domestic listening environments.",
