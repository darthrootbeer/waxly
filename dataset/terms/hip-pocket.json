  "definition": "**noun / novelty.** A super-thin 4-inch or 6-inch flexible vinyl single sold in the late '60s as an ultra-portable format designed to slip into a shirt or jeans pocket. Pressed on lightweight, bendable vinyl compound similar to flexi-discs but typically thicker and more durable, hip-pocket discs were marketed as the ultimate in portability during the height of the youth culture movement. Major labels including RCA and Columbia experimented with the format between 1967-1970, often packaging promotional singles or budget releases in colorful sleeves that emphasized their pocket-friendly dimensions. Sound quality was acceptable but inferior to standard 7-inch vinyl due to the thinner material and narrower grooves required for the compact size. The format never gained significant traction against cassettes and 8-tracks for portable music, and production ceased by the early 1970s. Today, hip-pocket discs are sought by novelty format collectors, with mint examples commanding moderate prices despite their promotional origins.",
