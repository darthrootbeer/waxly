  "definition": "**noun / slang.** A record cut with higher-than-normal groove amplitude for maximum loudness and punch — common on club 12-inch singles and some early rock LPs. The practice emerged in the 1960s when mastering engineers began pushing cutting lathes beyond conservative standards to achieve competitive loudness, particularly for jukeboxes and radio play. Hot cuts feature wider groove excursions that translate to higher playback volume without adjusting the turntable's gain, giving records immediate impact on dancefloors or when A/B'd in record stores. The technique carries risks: grooves can be cut so hot they approach neighboring grooves, causing potential distortion, skipping on lesser turntables, or faster stylus wear. Disco and early hip-hop 12-inches from the late 1970s through 1990s are legendary for aggressive hot cuts that sacrifice playing time for sheer sonic assault. Modern reissue labels occasionally replicate hot cuts for authenticity, though digital mastering allows more precise control of groove modulation than vintage all-analog chains permitted.",
