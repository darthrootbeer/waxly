  "definition": "**noun / hi-fi accessory.** Special **vibration-damping feet or cones** placed under turntables or amplifiers to reduce **acoustic feedback and structural vibration**. These devices work by either decoupling equipment from resonant surfaces or providing controlled energy dissipation through specialized materials. Common designs include **spiked cones** (typically machined aluminum or brass that concentrate weight onto minimal contact points), **elastomer pads** (rubber or synthetic compounds that absorb vibrations), and **mass-loading footers** (heavy metal cylinders that add inertia). Emerged in the **1970s audiophile movement** as turntable manufacturers recognized that floor-borne vibrations and speaker feedback could reach the stylus and cause audible distortion. **DJ culture** adopted isolation solutions by the 1980s for club environments where massive sound systems created extreme feedback conditions. Materials range from affordable **Sorbothane pads** ($20-50) to exotic **ceramic ball-bearing isolators** ($500+ per set). Effectiveness depends on turntable mass, floor construction, and room acoustics. **High-end models** incorporate multiple materials in sandwich construction to address different frequency ranges. Modern **direct-drive decks** benefit less than **belt-drives** due to inherent motor isolation, though footer upgrades remain popular tweaks among vinyl enthusiasts seeking incremental sonic improvements.",
