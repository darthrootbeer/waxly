  "definition": "**noun / packaging / historical.** An LP jacket style where a printed paper \"slick\" is glued onto a blank cardboard shell — common in the U.S. during the 1950s–70s. The manufacturing process involved printing album artwork on thin, coated paper stock, then adhering it to unprinted chipboard jackets using industrial adhesives. This method proved more economical than direct printing for smaller runs and allowed for faster turnaround times. The paste-on technique is easily identified by examining jacket edges, where the paper layer visibly overlaps the cardboard base, and by checking seams where the slick often shows wear or separation. Budget labels and independent pressings favored this construction throughout the 1960s, though major labels also employed it for standard releases. Over time, paste-on jackets are prone to edge peeling, corner lifting, and adhesive yellowing — conditions that significantly impact collector grading. The method largely disappeared by the late 1970s as direct-print and laminated jacket technologies became more cost-effective.",
