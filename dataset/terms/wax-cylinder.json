  "definition": "**noun / historical format.** A **cylindrical wax-based recording medium** used in phonographs before flat discs — dominant in the 1890s–1900s. Introduced commercially by Thomas Edison in 1888, these hollow cylinders (typically 2-4 inches long) featured spiral grooves cut vertically into soft wax surfaces, with playback achieved by a stylus tracking the hill-and-dale modulation. Early brown wax cylinders (1890s) offered roughly 2 minutes of audio and wore quickly, while later molded black wax and celluloid versions (post-1902) proved more durable. Edison's format competed fiercely with Berliner's flat disc through the 1900s, ultimately losing by 1929 when Edison discontinued production. Collectors prize early spoken-word recordings, rare musical performances, and pristine examples in original packaging. Playback requires specialized cylinder phonographs with mandrels matching the cylinder's diameter — equipment increasingly scarce outside museum collections. Values range from $5 for common titles to thousands for rare artists or mint condition specimens.",
