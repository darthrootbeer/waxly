  "definition": "**noun / sequencing term.** A **single extended composition that fills nearly an entire LP side** — typical in prog-[rock](../r/rock.md), [ambient](../a/ambient.md), [jazz](../j/jazz.md), or DJ-mix albums. Emerged in the late 1960s when artists began exploiting the LP format's 20-25 minute per-side capacity for uninterrupted musical statements. Progressive rock bands like Yes (*\"Close to the Edge\"*) and Pink Floyd (*\"Echoes\"*) pioneered the format, while jazz artists like Miles Davis (*\"Bitches Brew\"*) used it for extended improvisations. The approach requires careful mastering to manage [inner-groove distortion](../i/inner-groove-distortion.md), as extended playing time reduces [groove](../g/groove.md) spacing and can compromise high-frequency response toward the label. Electronic and ambient artists from Brian Eno to Aphex Twin have embraced side-long formats for immersive listening experiences. Modern DJ mix albums and dance compilations frequently employ side-long continuous mixes. Reissue labels often preserve original side-long sequencing even when digital formats eliminate physical constraints, recognizing the compositional intent behind the format.",
