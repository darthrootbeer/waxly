  "definition": "**noun / cutting-room slang.** A **lacquer cut optimised for a particular 'zone' of the disc surface** — typically concentrating program material in the outer grooves where linear velocity is highest, allowing for wider groove spacing and increased amplitude. Most commonly employed for dance 12-inch singles, where a track is deliberately cut only in the outer 3-4 inches of the disc, sacrificing playing time (often just 4-6 minutes per side) for maximum volume and bass response. The practice emerged in the late 1970s disco era when club DJs demanded louder cuts that could compete with the limitations of sound system equipment. Engineers would sometimes leave the inner zones completely blank or use them for brief bonus tracks. The technique exploits the physics of vinyl playback: outer grooves move past the stylus faster, reducing distortion and improving high-frequency response. Modern reissue labels occasionally recreate zone-cuts for authenticity, though digital mastering has reduced the technical necessity.",
