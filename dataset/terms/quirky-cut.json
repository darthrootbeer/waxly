  "summary": "'**noun / packaging.** A record jacket with **non-standard die-cut shapes**.",
  "definition": "**noun / packaging.** A record jacket with **non-standard die-cut shapes** — e.g., circular windows, puzzle-piece edges, odd silhouettes — for visual or promotional impact. Emerging in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s, quirky-cut sleeves distinguished themselves from simple center-hole die-cuts by employing irregular, artistic, or thematic shapes that enhanced album artwork or revealed strategic portions of inner sleeves. The Rolling Stones' *Sticky Fingers* (1971) featured a working zipper die-cut, while Andy Warhol's banana peel-off design became iconic. Production costs ran significantly higher than standard jackets due to custom die requirements and increased waste material. Popular through the 1970s prog-rock and art-rock movements, the format declined in the 1980s as labels cut budgets. Modern reissues occasionally replicate original quirky-cut designs for deluxe editions, though simplified versions are common. Collectors prize original pressings with intact die-cut elements, as wear, tears, and missing pieces dramatically reduce value.",
