  "definition": "**noun / technical.** Cumulative groove damage caused by repeated plays, especially with heavy or worn styli — manifests as hiss, distortion, or loss of high-end detail. The phenomenon became a recognized concern in the early LP era (1950s) when audiophiles discovered that even properly-maintained records degraded over time. Each stylus pass removes microscopic amounts of groove wall material, with the highest frequencies (above 10kHz) deteriorating first due to their smaller groove modulations. Heavy tracking forces (above 2.5 grams) accelerate damage exponentially, as do worn or improperly-aligned styli that concentrate pressure on specific groove areas. Spherical styli cause more uniform wear than elliptical or line-contact profiles, which paradoxically can reveal previous damage from inferior needles. Playback wear is irreversible and cumulative — a record played 100 times with a 2-gram tracking force shows significantly more degradation than one played 10 times. Collectors often maintain \"play copies\" and \"archive copies\" to preserve pristine originals. Modern advances in stylus design (Shibata, microline) and lighter tracking forces (1-1.5 grams) have reduced but not eliminated the issue, making playback wear a permanent consideration in vinyl longevity and the ongoing analog-versus-digital preservation debate.",
