  "definition": "**noun / historical.** A vertically-cut, thick disc record format (80 RPM, ¼-inch thick) invented by Thomas Edison in 1912 as a rival to lateral-cut 78s. Unlike standard shellac records that used side-to-side groove modulation, Edison Discs employed hill-and-dale (vertical) cutting, requiring specialized diamond-stylus phonographs incompatible with conventional players. Pressed from condensite (a phenolic resin), these discs were marketed as superior in fidelity and durability to Victor and Columbia's lateral 78s. Edison stubbornly maintained the format until 1929, years after lateral-cut records had dominated the market. The company's refusal to license popular music and Edison's personal interference in artist selection hastened commercial failure. Today, Edison Discs remain collectible curiosities, valued for their historical significance and unusual repertoire of early 20th-century recordings. Playback requires period-correct equipment or specialized modern turntables with vertical-tracking capabilities, making them among the most challenging early formats to properly audition.",
