  "definition": "**noun / cutting-room slang.** A **rare groove-geometry quirk where two run-out spirals merge like a 'Y'-shaped junction** — usually from a cutting-lathe mis-feed or playful locked-groove trick. Occurs when a lathe operator initiates a second lead-in or run-out groove that intersects an existing spiral path, creating a physical fork in the vinyl surface. Most Y-grooves result from test-cut errors during acetate or lacquer mastering, though experimental artists in the 1960s-70s occasionally engineered them deliberately for multi-path playback effects. The stylus encounters the junction and randomly follows one branch or the other, producing unpredictable track sequences—a technique exploited on novelty records and avant-garde releases. Authentic Y-grooves are exceedingly rare on commercial pressings due to quality control, making them prized anomalies among vinyl oddity collectors. Modern examples surface primarily on limited-run art editions or as documented pressing plant mistakes that escaped destruction.",
