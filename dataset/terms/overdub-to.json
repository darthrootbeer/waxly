  "summary": "noun / recording method. A studio technique where additional instruments.",
  "definition": "**noun / recording method.** A studio technique where additional instruments or vocals were recorded live while cutting straight to disc, layering takes without tape — used occasionally in the 1940s-50s. Engineers would play back the original lacquer on one turntable while simultaneously recording new performers alongside that playback to a second cutting lathe, creating a composite recording in real-time. This primitive overdubbing method predated multitrack magnetic tape and required exceptional timing and performance precision, as mistakes meant starting over from scratch. Les Paul pioneered variations of this technique in the late 1940s using disc-to-disc transfers to build his revolutionary multi-layered guitar recordings. The method was largely abandoned after 1950 when magnetic tape enabled non-destructive overdubbing with superior sound quality and unlimited takes. Rare examples occasionally surface among 78rpm-era jazz and experimental recordings, prized by collectors for their historical significance and the audible artifacts of the layering process.",
