  "definition": "# X-Cut Test Groove\n\nA specialized test groove cut into lacquer masters or test pressings containing deliberately exaggerated lateral and vertical modulations, used by pressing plants and mastering engineers to evaluate cutting equipment calibration and playback system tracking ability. The X-cut pattern produces extreme stylus movement in both horizontal (stereo channel separation) and vertical (bass response) planes simultaneously, creating one of the most demanding torture tests for turntable cartridges and tonearms. Introduced in the 1960s alongside stereo LP production, these grooves helped engineers identify mistracking, distortion, and phase issues before committing to full production runs. Modern audiophile test records still include X-cut sections to assess system setup, particularly for evaluating anti-skate adjustment, cartridge alignment, and tracking force optimization. The term derives from the cross-shaped Lissajous pattern the groove creates when viewed on an oscilloscope, representing the combined lateral and vertical signal components that form the stereo soundfield.",
