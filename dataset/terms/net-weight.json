  "definition": "**noun / manufacturing term.** The measured weight in grams of the raw vinyl \"biscuit\" pellet pressed into each record — determines final disc thickness (e.g., 140 g, 180 g, 200 g). Standard 12-inch LPs typically range from 120-140 g, while \"heavyweight\" or \"audiophile\" pressings clock in at 180-220 g. The net-weight directly influences groove depth, surface stability, and resistance to warping, though heavier doesn't automatically mean better sound quality — pressing precision and compound formulation matter equally. During the 1970s oil crisis, labels reduced net-weights to as low as 80-100 g to cut costs, resulting in notoriously flimsy, warp-prone discs. The 180 g standard emerged in the 1990s audiophile reissue market as a quality signifier, championed by labels like Classic Records and Music Matters. Modern pressing plants measure net-weight precisely before stamping, adjusting for label thickness and compound shrinkage. Collectors often cite net-weight in listings, though it remains just one factor in overall pressing quality alongside vinyl purity, stamper condition, and press calibration.",
