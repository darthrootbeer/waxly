## Half-Speed Mastering
**noun / technical.**
A mastering process where the lacquer is cut at half the normal playback speed (16⅔ RPM for a 33⅓ LP). This lets the cutting head trace high-frequency detail more accurately, reducing distortion and improving transient response.

**Etymology:** Literal — the lacquer is *mastered* while the lathe spins at *half-speed.*

**Example:** 
“The Abbey Road half-speed mastering of that Police album reveals more shimmer in the cymbals.”

**Cultural Note:** A prized audiophile selling point in the late ’70s and a revived premium option today.

**See also:**  audiophile pressing, lacquer cut, hot-cut

## Hand-Etched Matrix
(**noun.**) A matrix/run-out inscription scratched by hand into the lacquer by the mastering engineer — often includes initials or pressing info.

**Etymology:** Plain description: the *matrix number* is *hand-etched.*

**Example:** 
“Look for the hand-etched ‘Porky Prime Cut’ in the dead-wax — that’s George Peckham’s signature.”

**Cultural Note:** Many legendary engineers left playful etchings — secret signatures that became collector folklore.

**See also:**  dead-wax, run-out etching, lacquer cut

## Hand-Numbered Edition
(**noun.**) A limited-press vinyl release individually numbered by hand on the jacket or insert — a common tactic for boutique or crowdfunding runs.
