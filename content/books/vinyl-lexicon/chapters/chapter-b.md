# Chapter B

> **Terms beginning with 'B'**

## Back-Spinning
**verb / noun.**
Spinning the record backward quickly — either to rewind to a section or to create the signature “stutter” sound effect in scratching.

**Etymology:** Self-descriptive — literally spinning the record backward.

**Example:** 
“Grandmaster Flash made that back-spinning breakbeat loop famous in the park jams.”

**Cultural Note:** Integral to hip-hop DJ technique; also used by radio DJs in the ’70s to censor live mistakes by rewinding a few seconds.

**See also:**  back-cue, transformer scratch

## Back-Splice (a.k.a. Back-Tape)
**noun / verb.**
The practice of taping or splicing two pieces of the same breakbeat back-to-back on reel-to-reel or acetate to create an endless loop before samplers existed.

**Etymology:** From the physical splicing of magnetic tape’s *back* end to its *front*.

**Example:** 
“Before Serato, Bronx DJs were doing back-splice edits on quarter-inch tape to extend the drums.”

**Cultural Note:** An ancestor of the remix and the breakbeat-loop aesthetic; shows how vinyl and tape cultures overlapped.

**See also:**  edit, reel-to-reel, breakbeat

## Balance Weight (Tonearm)
(**noun.**) The counterweight at the rear of a tonearm used to set the proper tracking force for the stylus.

**Etymology:** Literal — balances the tonearm.

**Example:** 
“After swapping carts, always reset the balance weight before dialing in tracking force.”

**Cultural Note:** Many ’70s consumer decks hid a spring inside instead of a visible weight; audiophiles prefer a solid machined counterweight.

**See also:**  tracking force, auxiliary weight, anti-skate

## Banding (Groove Banding)
(**noun.**) Visible spacing or “bands” in the grooves of an LP that indicate separate tracks; silent grooves cut between songs.


**Etymology:** Refers to the *bands* of smooth, unmodulated groove between recorded sections.


**Example:** “You can spot the drum solo on that prog LP by the narrow band halfway through side two.”


**Cultural Note:** Some concept albums were cut without banding to create a continuous play-through.


**See also:**  locked groove, run-out groove, hidden track

## Basket-Case Copy
**noun / slang.**
Collector slang for a record in extremely poor physical condition — warped, cracked, or otherwise beyond realistic repair.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from general slang meaning “hopeless case.”

**Example:** 
“That first-press *Kind of Blue* looked tempting, but it’s a basket-case copy — water damage everywhere.”

**Cultural Note:** Some collectors still buy basket-case copies of ultra-rare titles just for the jacket or label variations.

**See also:**  VG, G-Plus, beater copy

## Beat-Matching
**verb / noun.**
The DJ technique of synchronizing the tempo and downbeat of two records so they blend seamlessly during a mix.

**Etymology:** Club-DJ jargon from the disco era — literally “matching the beats.”

**Example:** 
“She beat-matched the house classic at 124 BPM over the acapella without touching the pitch slider.”

**Cultural Note:** Invented by early disco DJs like Francis Grasso in the late ’60s/early ’70s — the skill that birthed modern club DJing.

**See also:**  pitch control

## Belt-Drive Turntable
(**noun.**) A turntable whose platter is spun by an elastic belt connecting it to a motor pulley — prized for vibration isolation but slower to start/stop than direct-drive.

**Etymology:** Describes the belt-driven design.

**Example:** 
“A belt-drive deck like the Rega Planar 3 gives a sweeter midrange but isn’t great for DJ scratching.”

**Cultural Note:** Dominant in hi-fi home decks of the ’70s–’90s; direct-drive won in clubs for torque and durability.

**See also:**  direct-drive, idler-wheel, wow & flutter

## Binaural Recording
(**noun.**) A recording technique using two microphones spaced roughly like human ears — intended for playback over headphones but fascinating on high-resolution vinyl.

**Etymology:** From *bi-* (“two”) + *aural* (“ears”).

**Example:** 
“That 1978 Sheffield Lab binaural LP puts the drum kit right in front of you in 3-D space.”

**Cultural Note:** A short-lived audiophile craze in the late ’70s; today prized by headphone enthusiasts collecting oddball pressings.

**See also:**  stereo, quadraphonic, dummy-head mic

## Blank Label (White-Label)
(**noun.**) A vinyl record with a plain label (often white) and no printed artwork, used for promos, DJ test cuts, or underground bootlegs.

**Etymology:** Straightforward — label area left blank or stamped with minimal info.

**Example:** 
“I’ve got the original U.K. white-label of that rave anthem — came in a die-cut sleeve with just a sticker catalog number.”

**Cultural Note:** Crucial to dance-music scenes (garage, jungle, techno) where DJs wanted hot tracks before official release.

**See also:**  promo copy, test press, dubplate

## Blank Groove / Locked Groove
(**noun.**) A closed circular groove at the end of a side that loops endlessly instead of spiraling to the label.

**Etymology:** “Locked” because the groove locks the stylus in a circle.

**Example:** 
“Sgt. Pepper’s U.K. first press has a cheeky locked groove with random gibberish after the final chord.”

**Cultural Note:** A playground for avant-garde and dance producers who’d hide Easter-egg audio or locked drum loops.

**See also:**  run-out groove, hidden track, banding

## Bootleg
**noun / slang.**
An unauthorized vinyl pressing of live concerts, unreleased studio takes, or remixes — often cut from radio broadcasts or tapes without the artist’s consent.

**Etymology:** From 19th-century “bootleg” smuggling — hiding contraband in boot tops.

**Example:** 
“That Dylan bootleg on Trade Mark of Quality came in a plain white jacket with a rubber-stamped pig logo.”

**Cultural Note:** Fueled rock-collector culture in the ’70s and rave remix culture in the ’90s; some bootlegs became historically significant.

**See also:**  pirate pressing, white-label, acetate

## Breakbeat
(**noun.**) The percussive instrumental section of a funk, soul, or disco record, historically looped by DJs as the rhythmic backbone for hip-hop, jungle, and breakdance.

**Etymology:** Refers to the *break* in the song where the beat plays alone.

**Example:** 
“The ‘Amen Brother’ breakbeat pressed to countless 12-inches basically invented drum-and-bass.”

**Cultural Note:** Foundation of multiple genres; breakbeat-hunting is still a crate-digger obsession.

**See also:**  battle breaks, back-splice, sampler

## Brush-Down (Record Brush)
**noun / verb.**
A quick cleaning pass using a carbon-fiber or velvet brush to remove surface dust before play.

**Etymology:** Literal — brushing down the record.

**Example:** 
“Give that LP a brush-down; static’s making the stylus crackle.”

**Cultural Note:** A ritualistic move for many collectors — the little flick before the needle drops.

**See also:**  anti-static brush, record-care kit, stylus cleaner
