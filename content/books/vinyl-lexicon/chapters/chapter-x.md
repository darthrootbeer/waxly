# Chapter X

> **Terms beginning with 'X'**

## X-Rated Cover Art

## X-Cut Test Groove
## X-Rated Cover Art
**noun / mastering test.**
A **trial lacquer groove cut in an ‘X’ pattern or cross-hatch** used by engineers to test cutterhead alignment and groove depth before committing to a full lacquer side.

**Etymology:** Studio slang — a test *cut* in the shape of an *X*.

**Example:** 
“The engineer made an X-cut test groove at the lacquer’s edge to check the stylus depth.”

**Cultural Note:** An obscure but real bit of cutting-room procedure rarely seen outside engineering circles.

**See also:**  test-cut lacquer, groove-depth gauge, lathe calibration

**noun / sleeve-collector slang.**
A **controversial or risqué LP jacket design** that was censored, replaced, or banned — often fuels collector demand.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from film-ratings slang — *X-rated* for explicit or shocking art.

**Example:** 
“The original X-rated cover art for the Scorpions’ *Virgin Killer* was quickly withdrawn, making first-press sleeves rare.”

**Cultural Note:** A major sub-genre in cover-art collecting; often the target of ‘banned-cover’ reissue hype.

**See also:**  banned-cover LP, alternate-sleeve variant, cover-swap edition

## X-Y Stereo Pickup Test
**noun / lab setup term.**
A **test configuration where two cartridges are mounted at 90-degree (X-Y) axes** to evaluate channel separation and crosstalk — used by cartridge designers and archivists.

**Etymology:** Lab shorthand — measuring stereo signal in *X* and *Y* axes.

**Example:** 
“The archivist’s X-Y stereo pickup test revealed 28 dB separation at 1 kHz.”

**Cultural Note:** Rarely encountered outside engineering or restoration labs.

**See also:**  crosstalk test, phase-coherence check, mono-switch test
