# Chapter E

> **Terms beginning with 'E'**

## E.Q. (Equalization)
**noun / abbreviation.**
The process of adjusting frequency balance during recording, mastering, or playback to achieve the desired tonal curve. Every vinyl record requires a specific playback EQ — usually the RIAA curve — to restore proper bass and treble.

**Etymology:** Short for *equalization* — balancing frequencies.

**Example:** 
“If the phono stage isn’t applying the RIAA E.Q. curve, your LPs will sound thin and tinny.”

**Cultural Note:** Before RIAA standardization (1954), labels used competing EQ curves, making pre-’55 discs tricky for archivists.

**See also:**  RIAA curve, preamp, tone control

## Edge-Warp
(**noun.**) A common vinyl defect where only the outer rim of a disc warps upward or downward, usually from heat or bad storage.

**Etymology:** Literal — warp along the disc’s *edge.*

**Example:** 
“That rare soul 45 has a slight edge-warp but still plays without skips.”

**Cultural Note:** Often fixable with flattening machines or glass-plate oven methods — though risky for prized LPs.

**See also:**  warp, dish-warp, de-warping

## Edison Disc
**noun / historical.**
A vertically-cut, thick disc record format (80 RPM, ¼-inch thick) invented by Thomas Edison in 1912 as a rival to lateral-cut 78s.

**Etymology:** Named after Thomas Edison’s company and format.

**Example:** 
“That antique cabinet still has Edison discs — you’ll need a special reproducer to play them.”

**Cultural Note:** Faded out by the 1930s but remains a niche interest for early-recording collectors.

**See also:**  vertical-cut groove, 78 RPM, acoustic gramophone

## Eight-Track (Cartridge)
(**noun.**) A continuous-loop magnetic-tape cartridge format popular in cars during the ’60s-’70s; often issued alongside LPs for portable listening.

**Etymology:** Named for its eight parallel magnetic tracks.

**Example:**

## Electric Pick-Up (Early Term for Cartridge)
**noun / historical.**
A 1930s-’50s term for the electro-magnetic cartridge that replaced acoustic soundboxes on gramophones.

**Example:** 
“This 1948 radio-console sports a mono electric pick-up with a sapphire needle.”

**Cultural Note:** Marked the transition from acoustic to electric playback, paving the way for hi-fi vinyl.

**See also:**  cartridge, crystal pick-up, mono stylus

## Elliptical Stylus
(**noun.**) A stylus tip shaped like a tiny ellipse rather than a sphere, allowing better contact with groove walls for higher-frequency tracking and reduced distortion.

**Etymology:** Named for its *elliptical* cross-section.

**Example:** 
“Upgrading to an elliptical stylus cleared up the inner-groove sibilance on my jazz LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** Became the audiophile standard for LP playback from the late ’60s onward.

## EP (Extended Play)
(**noun.**) A record release longer than a single but shorter than a full LP — often 3-6 songs. Commonly a 7-inch at 33⅓ RPM or a 12-inch with shorter runtime.

**See also:**  single, LP, maxi-single

## Equal-Loudness Curve
(**noun.**) A frequency-response graph (e.g., Fletcher-Munson) showing how human hearing perceives bass/treble at different volumes — influences mastering and tone-control design for vinyl playback.

**Etymology:** Describes curves of *equal perceived loudness.*

**Example:** 
“Old loudness buttons on receivers boost bass per the equal-loudness curve to compensate for low-volume listening.”

**Cultural Note:** Part of why vintage receivers have “loudness” switches beloved by late-night LP listeners.

# 45 RPM Adapter (a.k.a. “Flip-Over Adapter”)

## Feedthrough
**noun / technical.**
A manufacturing defect where a loud signal on one groove wall slightly imprints as a faint echo in the adjacent groove, audible a split-second early or late.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — audio “feeds through” the lacquer wall during cutting or pressing.

**Example:** 
“You can hear pre-echo on that quiet piano intro — classic feed-through groove from a hot cut.”

**Cultural Note:** Common on hot-cut 12-inch singles; largely minimized by modern plating techniques.

**See also:**  pre-echo, hot cut, lacquer-cut

## Fidelity
(**noun.**) A measure of how accurately a playback or recording system reproduces the original sound — the holy grail for audiophiles comparing pressings.

**Etymology:** From Latin *fidelis* meaning “faithful.”
