> **Terms beginning with 'I'**

## Idler-Wheel Drive
(**noun.**) A classic turntable mechanism where a rubber-covered wheel transmits power from the motor spindle to the platter’s inner rim — famous for torque and “drive,” often with slight rumble.

**Etymology:** Named for the intermediate *idler-wheel* that connects motor to platter.

**Example:** 
“That Thorens TD-124 uses idler-wheel drive — you can feel the platter leap to speed almost instantly.”

**Cultural Note:** Dominated radio-station decks and early hi-fi tables of the 1950s-60s; revered today by restorers for its punchy sound.

**See also:**  direct-drive, belt-drive, rim-drive

## Inner-Groove Distortion
**noun / technical.**
Audible high-frequency harshness or sibilance that occurs near the record’s center due to the stylus tracing a tighter groove radius at lower linear speed.

**Etymology:** Literal — distortion at the *inner grooves.*

**Example:** 
“Switching to an elliptical stylus cleaned up the inner-groove distortion on the final track.”

**Cultural Note:** Cartridge alignment, stylus profile, and groove-spacing strategies were all developed to combat this LP limitation.

**See also:**  tracking-angle, elliptical stylus, Baerwald alignment

## Inner Sleeve
(**noun.**) The paper or plastic sleeve that directly houses a vinyl record inside the outer jacket — protects against dust, scuffs, and static.

**Etymology:** Literal — the *sleeve* inside the jacket.

**Example:** 
“Replace those yellowed paper inner sleeves with anti-static poly-lined ones to protect your collection.”

**Cultural Note:** Printed lyric inner sleeves became a major artistic canvas in the LP boom of the ’70s.

**See also:**  outer jacket, poly-lined sleeve, lyric sheet

## Inner-Sleeve Rash
**noun / slang.**
A cloudy or mottled vinyl surface pattern caused by reaction with cheap PVC or acidic paper inner sleeves — usually cosmetic but sometimes noisy.

**Etymology:** Collector slang likening the cloudy marks to a skin *rash.*

**Example:** 
“That ’80s new-wave LP shows mild inner-sleeve rash from decades in PVC liners.”

**Cultural Note:** One reason collectors replace vintage PVC or acidic sleeves with modern archival ones.

**See also:**  poly-lined sleeve, visual-grade, play-grade

## In-Store Play Copy
**noun / slang.**
A record kept by a shop specifically for demonstration on the store turntable so customers could sample albums before buying.

**Etymology:** Retail slang — a copy meant for *in-store play.*

**Example:** 
“That Motown 45’s sleeve is stamped ‘In-Store Play Copy — Not for Resale.’”

**Cultural Note:** Common in mid-century record shops and department stores; some stamped copies became collectible variants.

**See also:**  promo copy, cut-out, demo copy

## Intermodulation Distortion
**noun / technical.**
A type of distortion created when two or more frequencies interact non-linearly in cartridge, amplifier, or speaker, producing unwanted sum-and-difference tones.

**Etymology:** Engineering term — *inter-modulation* of signals creating spurious components.

**Example:** 
“Excessive tracking force can raise intermodulation distortion on complex brass passages.”

**Cultural Note:** A key spec scrutinized by hi-fi magazines during the ’70s vinyl equipment wars.

**See also:**  THD, cartridge compliance, frequency response

## Isolation Feet / Isolation Platform
(**noun.**) Shock-absorbing feet or platforms placed under turntables or amps to minimize vibration from floors, speakers, or footsteps.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — devices that *isolate* gear via special *feet* or a platform.

**Example:** 
“Add Sorbothane isolation feet to tame foot-fall feedback on that suspended-floor rack.”

**Cultural Note:** Became popular in the ’80s-’90s as vinyl audiophiles chased lower noise floors.

**See also:**  plinth, wall-mount shelf, foot-fall feedback

## Italian Pressing
**noun / collector term.**
Any record manufactured in Italy — often identifiable by label fonts, SIAE stamp, or unique laminated sleeves; sometimes praised for warm mastering on ’70s prog and film-score LPs.

**Etymology:** Straightforward — a *pressing* from *Italy.*

**Example:** 
“The Italian pressing of that Morricone soundtrack has a more cinematic low-end than the U.S. cut.”

**Cultural Note:** Highly collected for Euro-prog, library music, and spaghetti-western soundtracks.

**See also:**  country-of-origin pressing, Japanese pressing, SIAE stamp

## Ivory-Label Variant
**noun / slang.**
A collector nickname for certain pressings distinguished by a pale ivory-colored label background — often limited to early or export runs.

**Etymology:** Descriptive of its *ivory* label color.

**Example:** 
“Hunt the ivory-label variant — it’s the true first-press before they switched to silver.”

**Cultural Note:** Such label-color changes can signal rare first-runs that fetch premium prices.

**See also:**  label variant, first pressing, collectors’ corner
