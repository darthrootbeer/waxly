> **Terms beginning with 'J'**

## Jacket
(**noun.**) The outer cardboard cover that houses a vinyl record and its inner sleeve. Often features the album’s artwork, spine title, liner notes, and catalog info.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from clothing — the protective *jacket* for a record.

**Example:** 
“The jacket’s still crisp and square — no seam splits despite forty years on the shelf.”

**Cultural Note:** The album jacket transformed records into visual art objects — fueling the golden age of LP cover design in the 1960s-80s.

**See also:**  inner sleeve, gatefold, picture sleeve

## Jacket Flap / Flap-Back Sleeve
(**noun.**) A jacket whose rear cover edges are folded over and glued on top of the back artwork, leaving visible “flaps.” Common on early U.K. and European LPs.

**Etymology:** Describes the *flaps* of card folded over.

**Example:** 
“Collectors look for intact laminate on those ’60s flap-back sleeves — they’re prone to peeling.”

**Cultural Note:** A tell-tale construction style for early Parlophone, Decca, and Columbia U.K. LPs.

**See also:**  laminated jacket, flip-back sleeve, UK pressing

## Jam Groove
**noun / slang.**
A long, often improvised instrumental section captured on record — prized by DJs for its extended rhythm bed.

**Etymology:** From live-band *jam* sessions laid into the *groove.*

**Example:** 
“Side-two’s jam groove rides that conga-drum vamp for six solid minutes — disco-DJ heaven.”

**Cultural Note:** A key ingredient in funk and disco 12-inch culture, supplying mix-friendly drum breaks.

**See also:**  breakbeat, club cut, instrumental dub

## Japanese Pressing
**noun / collector term.**
Any vinyl record manufactured in Japan, renowned for meticulous QC, quiet virgin-vinyl compound, and often warmer mastering choices.

**Etymology:** Literal — a *pressing* made in *Japan.*

**Example:** 
“The Japanese pressing of that Fleetwood Mac LP is dead-quiet between tracks and comes with an obi-strip.”

**Cultural Note:** Coveted for jazz, city-pop, and ’70s-’80s rock titles; obi-strip intactness greatly affects resale value.

**See also:**  obi strip, virgin vinyl, country-of-origin pressing

## J-Cut (Splice Edit)
**noun / slang / editing term.**
A style of tape or digital edit where the incoming track’s audio starts just *before* the visual or beat transition — in vinyl DJ terms, cueing the next track’s intro so it “bleeds in” under the tail of the previous.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from film-editing “J-cut,” whose audio track shape resembles the letter “J.”

**Example:** 
“He did a slick J-cut bringing the synth pad in before the breakbeat dropped.”

**Cultural Note:** An advanced beat-matching and mix-transition trick carried over from film/post-production lingo.

**See also:**  beat-matching, L-cut

## J-Cut Groove (Pressing Defect)
**noun / slang.**
A rare cutting-lathe mishap where the groove briefly swerves sideways forming a “hook” shape, causing a click or mistrack.

**Etymology:** Named for the unintended groove path resembling a capital “J.”

**Example:** 
“Side-one has a tiny J-cut groove near the intro — the stylus pops every rotation.”

**Cultural Note:** Usually confined to small sections of defective stampers — prized pressings can still suffer it.

**See also:**  pressing defect, groove-jump, locked groove

## J-Curve Tonearm
(**noun.**) A tonearm shaped with a gentle “J” bend near the headshell end, often seen on broadcast and some DJ decks — believed to optimize geometry and reduce tracking error compared to straight arms.

**Etymology:** Named for its curved “J”-like shape.

**Example:** 
“Vintage Technics broadcast tables often used a J-curve tonearm for better inner-groove tracking.”

**Cultural Note:** Classic look of ’70s-’80s pro turntables; still a design-choice debate among audiophiles vs straight-arm fans.

**See also:**  S-arm, straight-arm, headshell

## J-Cut Single (Collector Slang)
**noun / slang.**
A record pressed with the lead-in groove unusually short — almost shaped like a “J” hugging the label — meaning the song starts very close to the label.

**Etymology:** Collector slang likening the shallow lead-in spiral to a “J” curve.

**Example:** 
“That soul 45 is a notorious J-cut single — cue-burned to death because the intro’s right at the label.”

**Cultural Note:** Often a quirk of certain ’60s-’70s 7-inch pressing plants.

**See also:**  lead-in groove, cue-burn, groove-spacing

## J-Curve EQ (Broadcast Quirk)
**noun / technical slang.**
A non-standard early-broadcast equalization curve used by some European stations pre-RIAA, reputedly shaped like the letter “J” on frequency graphs — today mainly an archivist’s footnote.

**Etymology:** From its *J-shaped* EQ curve response.

**Example:** 
“Old acetates from that station need J-curve EQ playback to sound right.”

**Cultural Note:** A reminder of the Wild-West era of EQ standards before worldwide RIAA adoption mid-’50s.

**See also:**  RIAA curve, NAB EQ, turnover frequency

## Jitter (Digital-to-Vinyl Transfers)
**noun / technical.**
Minute timing errors in a digital source’s clock signal that can subtly blur transients when cut to lacquer — an audiophile concern for digitally mastered vinyl.

**Etymology:** Engineering term for irregular *jitter* in clock pulses.

**Example:** 
“Some purists claim high-end DACs reduce jitter artifacts before the vinyl lacquer stage.”

**Cultural Note:** One battleground in the analog-vs-digital vinyl debate of the 2000s-present reissue boom.

**See also:**  DSD mastering, half-speed mastering, lacquer cut

## Jukebox EP
(**noun.**) A 7-inch extended-play record made specifically for jukeboxes — often with oversized center holes and 33⅓ RPM speed to squeeze 2-3 songs per side.

**Etymology:** Literal — an *EP* tailored for *jukebox* mechanisms.

**Example:** 
“The diner’s Seeburg still spins vintage jukebox EPs with four Elvis tunes on one disc.”

**Cultural Note:** A vital transitional format during the late-’50s as jukebox operators wanted more songs per slot without upsizing the machine.

**See also:**  45 adapter, 7-inch single, changer spindle

## Jukebox Strip
(**noun.**) The small printed paper or card label inserted into a jukebox title slot identifying the record’s artist and song — collectible ephemera for matching vintage 45s.

**Etymology:** Plain description — the title *strip* for a *jukebox* slot.

**Example:** 
“Complete your jukebox 45 with the original jukebox strip to boost its display value.”

**Cultural Note:** Original strips are highly prized among 45-rpm collectors for period-correct display.

**See also:**  45 adapter, jukebox EP, ephemera

## Jump-Groove
**noun / slang.**
When the stylus unintentionally hops across one or more grooves — either forward or backward — often due to warps or vibration; similar to groove-jump.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — the needle *jumps* the *groove.*

**Example:** 
“The scratched 12-inch jump-grooves every time the bass hits.”

**Cultural Note:** Common bane of DJs in vibrating club booths and of worn household turntables with light tracking.

**See also:**  groove-jump, skip, foot-fall feedback
