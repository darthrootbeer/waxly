## Vertical-Cut Groove (Hill-and-Dale Cut)
**noun / historical groove style.**

**Etymology:** Descriptive — groove cut in *vertical* “hill-and-dale” undulations.

**Example:** 
“Edison Diamond Discs require a stylus designed for vertical-cut grooves.”

**Cultural Note:** A key early format war: Edison vertical-cut vs. Victor lateral-cut before the 1920s.

## Vertical Tracking Angle (VTA)
**noun / cartridge alignment spec.**
The **angle of the cantilever/stylus relative to the record surface in the vertical plane**, ideally matching the angle of the cutter head.

**Example:** 
“Raise the arm slightly to optimize vertical tracking angle for those 200-g reissues.”

## Vertical-Tracking Linear Arm (Tangential Arm)
**noun / turntable design.**
A **tone-arm that moves linearly on a rail to maintain a tangential angle across the disc’s radius**, reducing tracking-angle error compared to pivot arms.
