> **Terms beginning with 'Y'**

## Yard-Sale Find
**noun / collector slang.**
A **record discovered at a yard sale, garage sale, or flea-market table**, often for a fraction of its collector value — the casual cousin of crate-digging.

**Etymology:** Colloquial — a *find* at a *yard-sale*.

**Example:** 
“Scored a Yard-Sale Find — a first-press *Kind of Blue* for two bucks in a milk crate on someone’s driveway.”

**Cultural Note:** A rite of passage story among vinyl hunters; many holy-grails resurface this way.

**See also:**  thrift-store find, dollar-bin dig, up-grade copy

## Yellow-Label Promo
**noun / collector term.**
A **promotional pressing distinguished by a yellow center-label** used by certain labels in the 1960s–70s to mark DJ/radio copies.

**Etymology:** Literal — promo run pressed with *yellow-label*.

**Example:** 
“The Motown yellow-label promo often contains the dedicated mono 45 mix prized by northern-soul DJs.”

**Cultural Note:** A niche but recognizable label-variant for collectors of 7-inch singles.

**See also:**  white-label promo, silver-label promo, mono-fold single

## Y-Groove Junction (Run-Out Crossover)
**noun / cutting-room slang.**
A **rare groove-geometry quirk where two run-out spirals merge like a ‘Y’-shaped junction** — usually from a cutting-lathe mis-feed or playful locked-groove trick.

**Etymology:** Visual description — run-out groove forms a *Y-groove junction*.

**Example:** 
“That avant-garde LP hides a Y-groove junction in the dead-wax that randomly drops the stylus into one of two locked loops.”

**Cultural Note:** A collector curiosity found on a few experimental or mis-cut discs.

**See also:**  locked-groove, spiral-track trick, run-out etching

## Y-Splitter RCA Cable
**noun / cabling accessory.**
A **cable or adapter that splits one RCA phono signal into two paths (or vice-versa)** — handy for mono-summing, sub-out feeds, or parallel recording chains.

**Etymology:** Shaped like the letter *Y*, hence *Y-splitter*.

**Example:** 
“Use a short Y-splitter RCA to sum the stereo cartridge to mono for 1950s LP playback.”

**Cultural Note:** A basic piece of patch-bay and audiophile toolkit.

**See also:**  mono-summing switch, ground-loop isolator, phono-preamp input

## Yoke-Mount Cartridge
**noun / cartridge-body style.**
A **cartridge whose generator assembly is supported by a central ‘yoke’ bracket** — an older construction style sometimes seen in broadcast or rugged DJ cartridges.

**Example:** 
## Zero-Inner-Groove-Distortion Cut
## Zero-Inner-Groove-Distortion Cut
