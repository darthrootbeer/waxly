> **Terms beginning with 'G'**

## Gatefold
(**noun.**) A record jacket that opens like a book, revealing inside artwork, lyrics, or extra photos — standard for many double-albums and deluxe editions.

**Etymology:** Printing term for a cover that *folds like a gate.*

**Example:** 
“The original prog-rock gatefold had wild Roger Dean landscapes across the inside spread.”

**Cultural Note:** A hallmark of the LP era’s visual storytelling — prized for posters, liner notes, and panoramic art.

**See also:**  double-album, inner sleeve, jacket art

## Generation Loss
**noun / technical.**
The gradual loss of fidelity that occurs each time a tape or disc is copied from another copy instead of the original master.

**Etymology:** From audio-engineering jargon describing *loss* of quality with each *generation* of duplication.

**Example:** 
“That bootleg LP came from a third-gen tape — you can hear the hiss and rolled-off highs.”

**Cultural Note:** Collectors hunt for “master tape” or first-gen lacquer cuts to avoid generation loss.

**See also:**  dub-plate, master tape, hot-cut

## Groove Burn
**noun / slang.**
Visible greyish streaking and audible distortion in vinyl caused by excessive tracking force or repeated heavy cue-burn at a single spot.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — grooves appear visually *burned.*

**Example:** 
“Club DJs hammered that intro so hard the record’s got permanent groove burn.”

**Cultural Note:** A classic giveaway of over-played disco 12-inches pulled from bargain bins.

**See also:**  cue-burn, groove-wear, tracking force

## Groove Guard
(**noun.**) A subtle raised lip molded around the outer edge (and sometimes inner label ring) of most modern LPs to keep grooves from touching flat surfaces when stacked or sleeved.

**Etymology:** A marketing term coined in the late ’50s for the *guard* ridge protecting grooves.

**Example:** 
“Early flat-edge Blue Notes lack the later groove guard that kept records safer in piles.”

**Cultural Note:** An industry standard after about 1960 — makes shipping and auto-changers safer for discs.

**See also:**  flat-edge pressing, edge-warp, stacking

## Groove-Jump
**noun / slang.**
When the stylus physically hops out of one spiral groove into the next (or back) — often due to a warp, foot-fall vibration, or too-light tracking.

**Etymology:** Literal — the needle *jumps* grooves.

**Example:** 
“Add a gram of tracking weight — that warped 12-inch keeps groove-jumping during the bass drop.”

**Cultural Note:** The bane of both DJs in the booth and hi-fi listeners with springy wooden floors.

**See also:**  skip, mistracking, foot-fall feedback

## Groove-Wear
(**noun.**) Cumulative erosion of groove walls from years of playback — especially with worn styli or excessive tracking force.

**Etymology:** Plain description: grooves become *worn.*

**Example:** 
“The LP looks clean but you can hear groove-wear in the crunchy cymbals.”

**Cultural Note:** A key grading factor for used vinyl — many ’50s-’70s jukebox 45s suffer heavy groove-wear.

**See also:**  groove-burn, play-grade, VG-grade

## Ground-Loop Hum
**noun / technical.**
A low 50/60 Hz hum caused by multiple components sharing an electrical ground at different potentials — common in turntable-to-amp setups if the ground wire is loose or missing.

**Etymology:** From the looped ground path that induces hum current.

**Example:** 
“Tighten the turntable ground screw — that ground-loop hum is drowning the intro.”

**Cultural Note:** A rite-of-passage troubleshooting moment for every new vinyl hobbyist.

**See also:**  ground-wire, shielding, phono pre-amp

## Ground-Wire (Turntable Ground Lead)
(**noun.**) A dedicated wire that bonds the turntable chassis to the amplifier’s ground to prevent hum and static.

**Etymology:** Literal — the *wire* for electrical *grounding.*

**Example:** 
“Don’t forget to hook the Technics ground-wire to the receiver’s GND post.”

**Cultural Note:** Almost every vintage deck came with a dangling ground-wire; many modern USB tables omit it.

**See also:**  ground-loop hum, shielding, phono stage

## Groovebox (DJ/Producer Slang)
**noun / slang.**
While technically an electronic sampler-sequencer, in vinyl-DJ slang it refers to portable drum-machine samplers (e.g., Roland MC-303) often used alongside turntables to add beats to records.

**Etymology:** Marketing name that entered club-DJ vernacular in the late ’90s.

**Example:** 
“Their live set was just two decks, a mixer, and a groovebox looping 808 kicks.”

**Cultural Note:** Bridges the vinyl-to-digital transition era of late ’90s dance music performance.

**See also:**  sampler, battle-breaks, live-PA

## Groove Spacing (Pitch)
**noun / technical.**
The distance between adjacent grooves on a record, determined by cutting-lathe pitch control; wider spacing allows louder cuts but shortens play-time.

**Etymology:** Literal — spacing of the *grooves.*

**Example:** 
“The 12-inch single’s wider groove spacing is why it slams louder than the LP mix.”

**Cultural Note:** A crucial factor in the disco-era hot-cut ‘loudness wars.’

**See also:**  hot-cut, flash-cut, inner-groove distortion

## Guitar-Shaped Picture Disc (Novelty Vinyl)
**noun / novelty.**
A shaped picture disc die-cut to resemble a guitar (or other object) while still playable around its circular center.

**Etymology:** Literal — *picture disc* pressed in a novelty *guitar* shape.

**Example:** 
“The glam-metal promo came on a neon-pink guitar-shaped picture disc for record-store displays.”

**Cultural Note:** A 1980s marketing gimmick for collectors and display pieces.

**See also:**  picture disc, color-vinyl pressing, die-cut sleeve
