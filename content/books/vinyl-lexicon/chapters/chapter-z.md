## Zero-Inner-Groove-Distortion Cut
## Zero-Balance Tone-Arm
**noun / hi-fi setup feature.**
A **tone-arm that’s first balanced to float level at ‘zero’ before dialing in the tracking-force with a calibrated counterweight** — standard on most quality decks.

**Etymology:** Plain — *zero-balance* = neutral-float starting point.

**Example:** 
“Always set a zero-balance tone-arm before adjusting the tracking force to 1.8 g.”

**Cultural Note:** A basic but critical step in cartridge setup for decades.

**See also:**  tracking-force gauge, anti-skate dial, arm-resonance check

**noun / mastering brag-line.**
A **lacquer cut whose geometry and groove-pitch management minimise the high-frequency distortion that typically appears near the label**.

**Etymology:** Promotional phrase — claims *zero* audible *inner-groove distortion*.

**Example:** 
“The audiophile reissue advertises a zero-inner-groove-distortion cut thanks to advanced pitch computer.”

**Cultural Note:** A selling-point during the late-’70s / early-’80s audiophile-LP boom.

**See also:**  inner-groove distortion, variable-pitch groove cutting, elliptical stylus

## Zero-Rumble Spec
**noun / deck spec slang.**
A **marketing claim that a turntable’s measured rumble was below the instrument’s noise-floor** — common ad lingo once quartz-locked direct-drives hit -70 dB or better.

**Etymology:** Spec-sheet boast — virtually *zero* audible *rumble*.

**Example:** 
“JVC’s zero-rumble spec brochures became a selling point for their ‘Super DD’ decks.”

**Cultural Note:** Part of the spec-war marketing language of the late-’70s hi-fi arms race.

## Zig-Zag Groove Guard
**noun / packaging-mould feature.**
A **slight zig-zag raised lip pattern on some LP edges or labels designed to keep stacked records’ grooves from rubbing when sleeveless**.

**Etymology:** Visual descriptor — edge/label lip moulded with a *zig-zag* pattern acting as a *groove-guard*.

**Example:** 
“The early RCA Dynaflex pressings added a zig-zag groove-guard ring to protect playing surfaces in shipping.”

**Cultural Note:** One of several experiments (groove-guard ring, raised-label ridge) in mid-century pressing plants.

**See also:**  groove-guard lip, raised-label ridge, stack-changer era

## Zipper-Cover Sleeve
**noun / iconic jacket gimmick.**
A **LP jacket featuring a real working zipper built into the cover art** — most famously the Andy Warhol-designed *Sticky Fingers* (1971).

**Example:** 
“Collectors inspect vintage *Sticky Fingers* zipper-cover sleeves for spine dents caused in shipping.”

**Cultural Note:** An iconic example of 1970s rock-art packaging innovation.

**See also:**  gimmick sleeve, die-cut jacket, peel-off banana cover

## Zip-Tone Pops / Static-Zip Noise
**noun / playback noise slang.**
A **crackly ‘zip-tone’ series of static pops heard on dusty or statically charged records at needle-drop**.

**Etymology:** Onomatopoeia — sounds like a faint *zip-tone* crackle.

**Example:** 
“A carbon-fiber brush before play stops most zip-tone pops on dry winter days.”

**Cultural Note:** A common nuisance in low-humidity climates; cured by anti-static cleaning and mats.

**See also:**  anti-static brush, static-cling sleeve, ground-wire hum

## Zone-Cut / Hot-Zone Mastering
**noun / cutting-room slang.**
A **lacquer cut optimised for a particular ‘zone’ of the disc surface** — e.g., cutting dance singles in the outer-zone only for louder grooves.

**Etymology:** Slang — track cut in a specific disc *zone* for max impact.

**Example:** 
“Some DJ 12-inches are zone-cut with just one loud track in the outer third of the disc.”

**Cultural Note:** A niche but effective dance-vinyl mastering tactic.

**See also:**  hot-cut lacquer, side-long track, inner-groove avoidance

## Zoo-Label Novelty 45
**noun / collector nickname.**
A **novelty-label 7-inch single released by small regional ‘zoo’-branded labels** in the 1950s-60s — term also loosely for any animal-mascot kids’ record label.
