## Needle-Talk (Stylus Talk)
**noun / historical slang.**
The faint mechanical sound heard directly from the stylus vibrating in the groove, audible close to the turntable even with amp volume off.

**Cultural Note:** A charming relic of purely mechanical gramophones and even modern carts at very high volumes.

**See also:**  acoustic phonograph, groove wall vibration, mechanical resonance

## Needle-Tip Size (Stylus Size)
**noun / technical.**

**Etymology:** Industrial term for *net weight* of raw material charge.

**Example:**

## Noise-Floor
**noun / technical.**

**See also:**  surface noise, low-noise vinyl compound, dynamic range

## Non-Fill (Pressing Defect)
**noun / manufacturing defect.**
A defect where molten vinyl fails to completely flow into the stamper during pressing, leaving small unfilled patches that cause ripping or tearing sounds during playback.

## Null-Test (Audio Phase Test)
**noun / technical.**
A test comparing two audio signals by inverting the polarity of one and summing them; any remaining sound reveals differences — used by engineers to check remasters or cartridge channel balance.

**Example:** 
“He ran a null-test between the needle-drop and digital master to expose EQ changes.”
