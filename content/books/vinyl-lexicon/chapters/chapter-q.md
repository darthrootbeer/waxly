**noun / format.**
A 1970s-era vinyl format engineered to deliver **four-channel surround sound** when played through compatible decoders and amps. Several competing systems existed — SQ, QS, and CD-4 — each encoding rear channels differently.

**Etymology:** From *quadra-* (four) + *phonic* (sound).

**Example:** 
“The Pink Floyd quadraphonic LP reveals swirling guitars behind you with the proper SQ decoder.”

**Etymology:** *Quad* playback + special *cut* stylus.

**Example:** 
“Upgrade to a quad-cut Shibata stylus to properly extract the CD-4 rear-channel info.”
