## Obi Strip
**noun / packaging.**
A narrow paper band wrapped vertically (sometimes horizontally) around Japanese LP jackets, printed with title, price, catalog info, or promotional blurbs. Considered part of the collectible packaging.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from Japanese word *obi* (kimono sash) describing its wrap-around style.

**Example:** 
“The Japanese pressing with its original obi strip intact is worth double the loose copy.”

**Cultural Note:** Essential to the value of Japanese pressings — many collectors hunt for intact obi strips.

**See also:**  Japanese pressing, hype sticker, insert

## Off-Center Pressing
**noun / pressing defect.**
A defect where the record’s center hole isn’t perfectly aligned with the stamper’s groove spiral, causing the tonearm to sway slightly as it plays.

**Etymology:** Literal — the spindle hole is *off-center*.

**Example:** 
“The piano notes waver in pitch because side one is an off-center pressing.”

**Cultural Note:** A common QC issue in some plants; often fixable by manually enlarging and re-centering the hole — at collector’s risk.

**See also:**  wow & flutter, pressing defect, QC reject

## Ohm Load (Cartridge Load Impedance)
**noun / technical.**
The input impedance — expressed in ohms — that a phono stage presents to a cartridge; critical for matching MC cartridges (often 100Ω–500Ω) and affecting frequency response.

**Etymology:** Electronics term — *ohm* is unit of resistance.

**Example:** 
“Dial the MC preamp’s ohm load down to 100Ω for that low-output coil cart.”

**Cultural Note:** A familiar tweak among audiophiles fine-tuning MC cartridge setups.

**See also:**  moving-coil cartridge, phono stage, capacitance loading

## One-Step Pressing (a.k.a. SuperVinyl One-Step)
**noun / audiophile manufacturing.**
A premium pressing method eliminating intermediate “mother” and “stamper” generations — stampers made directly from the lacquer or DMM copper master, reducing generational loss.

**Etymology:** Describes the single-*step* plating process.

**Example:** 
“The one-step pressing of that jazz classic has incredible microdetail compared to the old two-step reissue.”

**Cultural Note:** Popularized by audiophile labels like Mobile Fidelity; marketed at collectors willing to pay high prices for minimal signal degradation.

## One-Sided LP / One-Sider
**noun / novelty / production choice.**
A record with grooves on only one side — the flip side left smooth, blank, or sometimes laser-etched with artwork.

**Etymology:** Plain — an LP playable on only *one side.*

**Example:** 
“That hardcore band’s 12-inch one-sider has music on side A and an etched logo on side B.”

**Cultural Note:** Common for EPs, singles, or art editions that don’t need both sides.

**See also:**  etched side, picture disc, limited edition

## Open-Reel to Vinyl Transfer
**noun / mastering process.**
The process of cutting a vinyl master directly from original open-reel analog tape as opposed to a digital remaster.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — source is *open-reel* tape going straight *to vinyl*.

**Example:** 
“This reissue boasts an open-reel-to-vinyl transfer — no digital stage in between.”

**Cultural Note:** A selling point highlighted in audiophile reissues aiming to stay fully analog (AAA).

**See also:**  AAA mastering, tape hiss, half-speed mastering

## Optical Soundtrack Disc (Historical)
**noun / historical.**
An experimental 1930s disc format that encoded film sound optically on a phonograph record, designed for synchronizing with motion pictures before magnetic film took over.

**Etymology:** Descriptive — audio track stored in *optical* form on a disc.

**Example:** 
“Some early talkies experimented with optical soundtrack discs spun in sync with the film reels.”

**Cultural Note:** An interesting dead-end technology bridging silent film to synchronized sound.

## Original Master Recording (OMR)
**noun / audiophile marketing term.**
A label designation — notably by Mobile Fidelity — indicating that the vinyl was mastered from the original master tape rather than a copy or safety dub.

**Etymology:** Self-descriptive marketing phrase: *original master recording*.

**Example:** 
“The OMR banner across the top strip is a hallmark of Mobile Fidelity’s early half-speed LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** A key phrase in the audiophile reissue world that drives collector value and debates about analog vs digital sourcing.

## Outer Jacket (Outer Sleeve)
**noun / packaging.**
The main printed cover that holds both the inner sleeve and the record — sometimes protected by an additional clear poly outer sleeve.

**Etymology:** Plain — the *outer* protective *jacket*.

**Example:** 
“The original outer jacket has sharp corners and no ring-wear — great for resale value.”

**Cultural Note:** The most visually iconic part of an LP — condition of the outer jacket heavily influences grading.

## Outer-Ring Clamp (Peripheral Ring)
**noun / hi-fi accessory.**
A heavy circular metal ring placed on the outer edge of the record during playback to flatten edge warps and improve platter contact.

**Cultural Note:** A premium accessory for audiophile turntables seeking perfectly flat tracking surfaces.

## Out-of-Print (OOP)
**noun / collector term.**
A record title no longer manufactured or distributed by the label, often becoming scarce and rising in secondary-market value.

**Etymology:** Publishing term applied to records — no longer *in print*.

**Cultural Note:** OOP status fuels collector demand and drives crate-digging hunts for long-lost editions.

**See also:**  limited edition, cut-out, warehouse find

## Overdub-to-Disc (Direct-to-Disc Overdub)
**noun / recording method.**
A studio technique where additional instruments or vocals were recorded live while cutting straight to disc, layering takes without tape — used occasionally in the 1940s-50s.

**Etymology:** *Over-dubbing* directly *to disc*.

**Example:** 
“Some hillbilly 78s were crude overdub-to-disc jobs — you can hear the balance shift mid-song.”
