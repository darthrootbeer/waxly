> **Terms beginning with 'C'**

# 33⅓ (Thirty-Three and One-Third RPM)
**noun / numeric.**
The standard long-playing (LP) record speed introduced by Columbia in 1948. At 33⅓ revolutions per minute, it allowed up to 20–25 minutes of music per side on a 12-inch disc.

**Etymology:** A direct reference to the platter’s rotation rate; the fractional speed originated from synchronous-motor design standards.

**Example:** 
“That old Sinatra 10-inch spins at 33⅓, so don’t set it to 45 or you’ll get chipmunk crooning.”

**Cultural Note:** Revolutionized albums by enabling entire symphonies, jazz sessions, and concept LPs on a single disc.

**See also:**  LP, microgroove, 45 RPM

# 45 Adapter (a.k.a. Spider, Dink)
(**noun.**) A small insert — usually plastic or metal — that fits into the large center hole of a 7-inch 45 RPM single so it can be played on a standard turntable spindle.

**Etymology:** Developed in the late ’40s after RCA launched the 45 RPM format with oversized center holes.

**Example:** 
“I keep a couple of brass 45 adapters taped to the turntable lid — the plastic spiders always vanish at parties.”

**Cultural Note:** In the U.K., most 45s used the small spindle hole, so U.S. adapters became a minor export item.

**See also:**  7-inch single, RCA 45, jukebox strip

# 78 RPM (Seventy-Eight)
**noun / numeric.**
The pre-LP disc speed standardized in the 1920s at about 78 revolutions per minute. Typically pressed on brittle shellac, playable for about three minutes per side.

**Etymology:** Named for its rotational speed; exact speeds varied (76–80 RPM) before true standardization.

**Example:** 
“Handle those 1930s blues 78s carefully — drop one and it’ll shatter like a cookie.”

**Cultural Note:** Collecting pre-war 78s is a specialized hobby with its own grading scale and turntable stylus sizes (2.7–3 mil).

**See also:**  shellac, steel needle, transcription disc

## Cabinet Rumble
(**noun.**) Low-frequency resonance transmitted from a speaker cabinet or furniture into the turntable, causing audible woofer flutter or muddy bass.

**Etymology:** Plain description: rumble caused by the cabinet.

**Example:** 
“Shift the turntable off that Ikea shelf — the sub’s causing cabinet rumble in the needle.”

**Cultural Note:** The reason hi-fi enthusiasts use isolation platforms, wall-mount shelves, or massive plinths.

**See also:**  acoustic feedback, plinth, isolation feet

## Carbon-Fiber Brush
(**noun.**) A staple record-cleaning tool whose ultra-fine conductive bristles sweep off dust while discharging static electricity from vinyl surfaces.

**Etymology:** Descriptive of the brush’s bristle material.

**Example:** 
“Run the carbon-fiber brush in slow circles — it’ll lift the lint and zap the static crackle.”

**Cultural Note:** Became popular in the late ’70s alongside anti-static inner sleeves.

**See also:**  anti-static brush, wet-cleaning solution, stylus brush

## Cartridge
(**noun.**) The removable electro-mechanical pickup at the end of a tonearm that holds the stylus and converts groove vibrations into electrical signals.

**Etymology:** Borrowed from “cartridge” as a self-contained component module.

**Example:** 
“Upgrading the cartridge to an Ortofon 2M Blue opened up the highs and detail on my jazz LPs.”

**Cultural Note:** A ritual upgrade path for audiophiles; DJ cartridges often feature reinforced cantilevers for rough handling.

**See also:**  stylus, headshell, tracking force

## Cat-No. (Catalog Number)
**noun / abbreviation.**
A unique alphanumeric code assigned by a label to identify a specific release or pressing — often printed on spine, label, and run-out.

**Etymology:** Short for “catalogue number.”

**Example:** 
“Compare the cat-no. on the spine: the first U.S. press is SD-19129, later reissue is 19129-2.”

**Cultural Note:** Essential to Discogs research and collector hunts for country- or year-specific editions.

**See also:**  matrix number, pressing plant code, label variant

## Center Hole / Spindle Hole
(**noun.**) The precisely-cut hole in the middle of every disc that seats on the turntable spindle; slight off-center drilling causes audible wow.

**Etymology:** Literal.

**Example:** 
“That pressing’s got an off-center hole — you can see the tonearm sway like a pendulum.”

**Cultural Note:** Quality control of center-hole drilling separates budget pressings from premium ones.

**See also:**  wow & flutter, 45 adapter, off-center pressing

## Changer (Record Changer / Stack-Loader)
(**noun.**) A turntable mechanism — popular mid-century — that automatically drops the next record from a stacked spindle after each side finishes.

**Etymology:** Named for its ability to *change* records automatically.

**Example:** 
“Grandma’s console stereo still has a five-disc changer — perfect for old box-set symphonies.”

**Cultural Note:** Fell out of audiophile favor due to record wear; now prized by nostalgia collectors restoring mid-century consoles.

**See also:**  automatic return, drop spindle, console stereo

## Clamshell Case
(**noun.**) A rigid plastic or cardboard hinged case for protecting 7-inch or rare 12-inch singles, often used by traveling DJs.

**Etymology:** Named after the shell-like hinge-opening design.

**Example:** 
“The reggae selector rolled up with a beat-up clamshell case full of blank-label dubplates.”

**Cultural Note:** An icon of mobile-DJ culture in the ’80s and ’90s.

## Clean-Cut Groove
(**noun.**) A precisely-cut groove with minimal burrs or swarf from the cutting lathe — often cited in marketing for high-fidelity pressings.

**Etymology:** Descriptive of a groove that’s “cleanly cut.”

**Example:** 
“The Japanese first press is famous for its clean-cut grooves that track like butter.”

**Cultural Note:** One hallmark of top-tier mastering houses and virgin-vinyl formulations.

## Cleaning Solution (Record-Cleaning Fluid)
(**noun.**) Specialized liquid, often alcohol-free with surfactants, used to dissolve dust, oils, and mold release from vinyl grooves.

**Etymology:** Literal — a solution for cleaning.

**Example:** 
“Don’t use straight rubbing alcohol; get a proper record-cleaning solution to protect the PVC.”

**Cultural Note:** Key to archival preservation — many collectors swear by DIY recipes vs. pricey commercial brands.

**See also:**  wet cleaning, vacuum RCM, anti-static brush

## Clip-On Headshell Weight
(**noun.**) A removable metal plate that clips onto a detachable headshell to increase cartridge mass for better stylus tracking at higher forces.

**Etymology:** Describes its clip-on design.

**Example:** 
“That vintage mono cart tracked too lightly, so I added a 2-gram clip-on headshell weight.”

**Cultural Note:** Common with heavy-tracking broadcast and mono cartridges in the ’50s-’70s.

**See also:**  auxiliary weight, tracking force, resonance control

## Closed-Groove Loop (Locked Groove)
(**noun.**) A special groove cut to circle back on itself, trapping the stylus to loop sound indefinitely — sometimes placed mid-side as an experimental effect.

**Etymology:** Literal description: groove is closed in a loop.

**Example:** 
“The noise-rock LP hides a screaming closed-groove loop halfway through side A — freaked me out the first time.”

## Compilation Album
(**noun.**) An LP or multi-disc set collecting songs from various artists or sessions — often themed by hits, genre, or label samplers.

**Etymology:** From *compile*, meaning to gather together.

## Console Stereo
(**noun.**) A mid-century piece of furniture integrating a turntable, tube amp, radio, and speakers into a long wooden cabinet — once a living-room centerpiece.
